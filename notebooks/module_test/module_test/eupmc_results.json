Multiple large-scale trials from around the world have produced conflicting outcomes in cancer-specific and overall mortality. A main part of the issue is the PSA test, which has a high degree of variability, making it challenging to set PSA thresholds, as well as limited specificity. Prostate cancer has a predisposition in men from black backgrounds, and outcomes are worse in men of lower socioeconomic groups. Mobile targeted case finding, focusing on high-risk groups, may be a solution to help those that most need it. The aim of this systematic review was to review the evidence for mobile testing for prostate cancer. A review of all mobile screening studies for prostate cancer was performed in accordance with the Cochrane guidelines and the PRISMA statement. Of the 629 unique studies screened, 6 were found to be eligible for the review. The studies dated from 1973 to 2017 and came from four different continents, with around 30,275 men being screened for prostate cancer. Detection rates varied from 0.6% in the earliest study to 8.2% in the latest study. The challenge of early diagnosis of potentially lethal prostate cancer remains an issue for developed and low- and middle-income countries alike. Although further studies are needed, mobile screening of a targeted population with streamlined investigation and referral pathways combined with raising awareness in those communities may help make the case for screening for prostate cancer.", "affiliation": "Department of Urology, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, London SW3 6JJ, UK.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng",

For this purpose, we develop AutoML models using different feature preselection methods and compare the results with previously developed conventional ML models. The cohort used for our study comprises T2-weighted MRI images of 124 patients with histologically confirmed gliomas. Using AutoML, we were able to develop sophisticated models in a very short time with only a few lines of computer code. In predicting IDH mutation status, we obtained a mean AUC of 0.7400 and a mean AUPRC of 0.8582. ATRX mutation status was predicted with very similar discriminatory power, with a mean AUC of 0.7810 and a mean AUPRC of 0.8511.

Most of those markers are glycoproteins, carrying cancer-specific glycan structures that can provide extra-information for cancer monitoring. Nonetheless, in the majority of cases, this differential feature is not exploited and the corresponding analytical assays detect only the protein amount, disregarding the analysis of the aberrant glycoform. Two exceptions to this trend are the biomarkers \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) and cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), which are clinically monitored for their cancer-related glycan changes, and only the AFP assay includes quantification of both the protein amount and the altered glycoform.

It is the fifth-leading cancer diagnosed in males across the globe. The mortality rate is quite high due to prostate cancer. Despite the fact that advancements in diagnostics and therapeutics have been made, there is a lack of effective drugs. Metabolic pathways are altered due to the triggering of androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathways, and elevated levels of dihydrotestosterone are produced due to defects in AR signaling that accelerate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Further, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways interact with AR signaling pathway and act as precursors to promote prostate cancer. Prostate cancer therapy has been classified into luminal A, luminal B, and basal subtypes. Therapeutic drugs inhibiting dihydrotestosterone and PI3K have shown to give promising results to combat prostate cancer. Many second-generation Androgen receptor signaling antagonists are given either as single agent or with the combination of other drugs. In order to develop a cure for metastasized prostate cancer cells, Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is applied by using surgical or chemical methods. In many cases, Prostatectomy or local radiotherapy are used to control metastasized prostate cancer. However, it has been observed that after 1.5 years to 2 years of Prostatectomy or castration, there is reoccurrence of prostate cancer and high incidence of castration resistant prostate cancer is seen in population undergone ADT. It has been observed that Androgen derivation therapy combined with drugs like abiraterone acetate or docetaxel improve overall survival rate in metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) patients. Scientific investigations have revealed that drugs inhibiting poly ADP Ribose polymerase (PARP) are showing promising results in clinical trials in the prostate cancer population with mCRPC and DNA repair abnormalities. Recently, RISUG adv (reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance) has shown significant results against prostate cancer cell lines and MTT assay has validated substantial effects of this drug against PC3 cell lines.
