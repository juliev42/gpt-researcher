INTRODUCTION\\nOsteoporosis is a disease that can be characterized as a “silent epidemic” because of its wide presence throughout the world and the continuing increase in the number of patients deserves full attention and appropriate multidisciplinary approach, both in prevention and in treatment. Close to 10% of the world’s population and 30% of post-menopausal women suffering from osteoporosis (1, 2). The main complications of osteoporosis and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly population are fractures (3). Osteoporosis involves a number of factors which can be divided into variable and constant factors i.e. genetic factors and factors from the environment (4). They can individually or in synergy significantly contribute to the loss of bone mass leading to osteoporosis (5-7). Recent scientific findings indicate that factors associated with poor living habits are also one of the most important factors contributing to the rapid loss of bone mineral density in postmenopausal women (8).\\n2. GOAL\\nThe goal of this study was to determine whether certain risk factors from the environment (smoking, drinking coffee and alcohol) contribute to the reduction of bone mineral density and occurrence of osteoporosis, and what is the impact of physical activity on bone mineral density in postmenopausal women.\\n3. MATERIAL AND METHODS\\nWorking Group (group of cases) consisted of 100 females in postmenopausal age (for at least two years after the last menstrual period) found to have a newly diagnosed osteoporosis in the Cabinet for Osteodensitometry (Clinic of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases, University Medical Center of RS) determining bone mineral density by DEXA method at the level of lumbar spine (L2-L4), hip, and the upper part of the femur.\\nThe control group (group of controls) consisted of 100 females in a postmenopausal age where after the determination of bone mineral density, by DEXA method, osteoporosis has not been determined.\\nExclusion criteria were malignant diseases, diabetes, thyroid, parathyroid and adrenal glands, chronic renal failure, inflammatory arthritis, the use of statins in the treatment of dyslipidemia, corticosteroids, hormones and diuretics for more than three months, secondary osteoporosis due to endocrine diseases, diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (Crohn’s disease, malabsorption), operations peptic ulcer, chronic liver disease, and osteoporosis induced by drugs.\\nIn order to collect demographic data and information on risk factors for osteoporosis and lifestyle of patients is used a questionnaire on Bone Mineral Density in Women of the Irish Association of Osteoporosis.\\n4. RESULTS\\nLooking at both groups, from a demographic point of view, the result shows that in the group of cases the mean age of respondents was 64 years, and in the control group 63 years which does not represent a statistically significant difference. In terms of education level in both groups dominated by women with primary or secondary education (in a group of cases 78% and in the control, group 84%), with no statistically significant difference between groups. Also in terms of occupation and marital status there were no statistically significant differences between groups (Table 1).\\nTable 1\\nIndependent indicators for the association of demographic data with osteoporosis. * X2 test ** t-test\\nTesting of the significance of differences in terms of smoking showed that the studied groups are statistically significantly different in terms of smoking (χ2=24.025, p=0.000). In the group of cases, smoking was present in 50%, and in the group of controls in 33% of the patients (Table 2).\\nTable 2\\nThe differences between group of cases and control group in terms of smoking, alcohol, coffee and physical activity\\nIn terms of consumption of coffee, a statistically significant difference was not found between the group of cases and control group (χ2=0.615, p=0.735). It can be observed that roughly the same number of women in both groups consumed coffee ≥ 3 cups/day, in a group of cases, 32% in the control group 27%. Moderate, or 1-3 cups/day consumed 37% of the women in group of cases, and 39% of respondents in control group. Coffee did not drink 31% of the women in group of cases, and34% of the control group.\\nWhen observing the obtained information about the consumption of alcohol, we find that this preventable risk factor in the present study did not show as significant for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (χ2=4.35, p=0.114). In both groups dominated by women who do not consume alcohol.\\nStatistical analysis shows that there are significant differences between the group of cases and control group in terms of physical activity (χ2=7.30, p=0.026) (Table 2).\\nTesting of variable risk factors for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women by logistic regression included all studied factors. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that smoking (p=0.000; OR=1.911) is significantly associated with the development of osteoporosis, and physical activity was protective factor for bone mineral density in women (p=0.036; OR=0.463). Coffee consumption ≥ 3 cups per day (p=0.472; OR=1.138) and alcohol >3 drinks per day (p=0.056; OR=0.352) were not significant risk factors for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (Table 3).\\nTable 3\\nRisk factors for osteoporosis identified by univariate logistic regression. * coefficient; † Odds Ratio; ‡ Confidence interval\\nResults of multivariate logistic regression showed that only smoking is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (OR=1.665; p=0.006) (Table 4).\\nTable 4\\nRisk factors for osteoporosis as identified by multivariate logistic regression * coefficient; † Odds Ratio; ‡ Confidence interval\\n5. DISCUSSION\\nOsteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease which in developed countries represent a very important social and medical problem and it is getting more and more a form of epidemic, as it has a steady increase in the number of cases (9). After age of 30 years the reduction of bone mass is an inevitable process, and consequently, changes in the bone remodeling cycle leading to bone fragility and increased risk of bone fractures (10). In osteoporosis are involved numerous factors which can be classified in the group of risk factors that cannot be influenced (unchangeable factors) and the risk factors that can be affected (variable or preventable factors) (11).\\nAmong the variable risk factors for osteoporosis, which are related to poor living habits, recent studies show that smoking has an important place because it leads to some changes in the level of microarchitecture of trabecular bone, which results in reduced bone resistance to mechanical stress and friction (12). Smokers, regardless of the gender have a higher risk of having osteoporotic fractures (13). Women who smoke are almost twice as likely affected by osteoporosis than women nonsmokers. Our results are consistent with other scientific studies, in which the prevalence of osteoporosis was much higher in the group of smokers (31.3%) compared to former smokers (28.6%) or non-smokers (7.5%) (14). The results of our study, in accordance with the previously imposed attitudes, have shown that smoking is a significant independent risk factor for osteoporosis (p=0.000, OR=1.911, 95% CI=1.378 to 2.648).\\nScientific findings on the impact of alcohol on bone mineral density show different results. According to certain studies, nonhazardous alcohol use (1.0 drinks per day) has a slightly positive effect on bone density because alcohol contains certain substances that may have the estrogen-like stimulatory effect on bone (15). Ilic and colleagues have found that a low intake of alcohol, mostly wine, is positively correlated with bone mineral density at the level of lumbar spine in postmenopausal women (16), while Berg and colleagues have shown that people who consume 0.5 to 1.0 drinks a day have a lower risk of hip fracture compared to abstainers or hazardous consumers (17). On the other hand, excessive alcohol consumption has a negative impact on the mechanism of bone remodeling, osteoblastic proliferation and activity, and therefore the direct negative effect on bone homeostasis (18). The results of univariate logistic regression in our study did not indicate that alcohol consumption of >3 drinks a day is a significant risk factor for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (OR=0.352, p=0.056). In both groups of respondents dominated abstainers which is consistent with other studies, according to which the majority of postmenopausal women do not consume alcohol. Nonhazardous alcohol consumption had 4% of the women in the group cases, and 8% in the control group, while we found hazardous alcohol consumption in 1% of respondents in the group of cases and 5% of the control group. Harmful drinking of alcohol did not report any of the respondents.\\nThe results of our study are consistent with other studies that have demonstrated the negative impact of high doses of caffeine to osteoporosis and fractures, particularly in postmenopausal women, which is a reflection of direct or indirect harmful effects of caffeine on osteoblastic activity (19,20). In fact, caffeine from coffee can lead to increased excretion of calcium in the urine, and that this loss cannot be fully compensated even 24 hours later. Caffeine intake leads to a decrease in interstitial absorption of calcium, and high doses of caffeine (>300 mg/g or ≥4 cups a day) can accelerate bone loss at the level of lumbar spine in older postmenopausal women (21). Logistic regression analysis in our study did not point that coffee consumption of ≥3 cups a day is a risk factor for osteoporosis (32% in a group of cases versus 27% in the control group (OR=1.138, p=0.472)).\\nFor healthy bone, it is necessary to regularly exercise and have physical activity, avoiding sedentary lifestyle, as if the bones are not energized and physical active, mechanoreceptors (osteocytes) do not receive signals about the need for remodeling, removal of damaged and synthesis of new bone, and so there is a gradual reduction of total bone mineral density (22). Physical activity or physical exercise in postmenopausal women have to provide the necessary voltage essential for maintaining bone density (23). Walking, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation, is one of the most effective form of exercise for the maintenance or improvement of bone mineral density in postmenopausal women (24). It was found that engaging in recreational sports or active walk (30-60 minutes) more than twice a week reduces the risk of osteoporosis and fractures in older postmenopausal women (25). Exercises by load of its own weight or exercise against resistance are effective for increasing bone density and aerobic exercises increase the balance and functional activity of muscles thus reducing the risks of falls (26). Data from other studies also suggest that physical activity is essential for bone health and the prevention of osteoporosis (27). In our study, the patients took a large percentage of cases were physically inactive, 74% in the group of cases versus 86% in the control group, which agrees with the results of other studies. The results of univariate logistic regression showed that physical activity is an important protective factor for osteoporosis (OR=0.463, p=0.036), as were women who were physically active less frequently suffered from osteoporosis.\\n6. CONCLUSION\\nMany preventable risk factors from the environment can have a significant impact on bone mineral density in postmenopausal women. The results of our study show that smokin'},\n",

The survey included questions assessing migrant background, demographic characteristics, lifestyle habits including physical exercise and smoking, prevention by vitamin D intake and bone densitometry, and information on personal and family medical history.

There were no significant differences regarding the use of bone densitometry.\\nConclusion\\nKnowledge of osteoporosis and the possibility of a bone densitometry as well as the implementation of preventive measures is low among women. Therefore, informing patients better should be a priority, with particular attention on the risks and needs of women with a migration background. Specific programs for women with and without migration background should be developed to increase the awareness of osteoporosis.\\nIntroduction\\nOsteoporosis is a disease of the skeletal system associated with a loss of bone mass and an increased risk of fractures. The lifetime risk of fracture is higher in women than in men [1]. An evaluation from 2006 to 2009 showed a fracture rate of 27% in those >\\u200950\\u2009years of age [2]. More recent analyses show fracture rates of up to 30% in those >\\u200970\\u2009years old and untreated for osteoporosis. This leads to a significant impact on patients’ quality of life and high costs for the health care system [3]. With increasing life expectancy, the number of elderly individuals is rising and the incidence of worldwide burden of fragility fractures is estimated to rise [4, 5]. Strategies to reduce this burden are needed by identifying individuals at risk and by increasing awareness of osteoporosis. The FRAX algorithm for example is a model, which enables the estimation of the patients’ absolute risk of fracture over the next 10\\u2009years [6].\\nAnother important strategy as mentioned above is to increase patient awareness of osteoporosis risk factors by increasing their knowledge to encourage them to take preventive measures and to improve compliance with therapy [7].\\nLifestyle factors such as smoking, high alcohol consumption, or lack of exercise also play a significant role in bone quality [8, 9]. Positive family history, vitamin D deficiency, reduced calcium intake, underweight (BMI <\\u200920), and age are discussed as additional risks for increased fracture rates [10–13]. There is clear evidence such as increasing physical activity, cessation of smoking, adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium may reduce the risk of osteoporosis [14].\\nAwareness of such risks and the options for primary prevention is essential in reducing the incidence of osteoporosis. Several studies [15–17] have examined the association between knowledge of osteoporosis and preventive behavior. Some of them have shown that the level of knowledge could improve the use of preventive measures such as increasing exercise and calcium intake [18]. In addition, there are only few studies, that have used a validated tool to measure the knowledge of osteoporosis such as the following: Osteoporosis Knowledge Assessment Tool (OKAT) used for a survey in the Australian population [19]; the Osteoporosis Assessment Questionnaire, or OPAQ for postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis [20].\\nBased on our information, no similar studies have researched the level of knowledge of osteoporosis within migrants and non-migrants.\\nSpecific frail groups in society, such as women with a migrant background seem to be confronted with significantly more impediments for taking up preventive measures and should therefore be specially considered [21]. Language barriers, poor working conditions, and low social status could increase the health risks for many migrant women [22, 23]. Increasing migration due to crisis situations in Europe and worldwide has led to ethnical and socio-cultural diversity in society and in health systems. These cohorts of patients should be reflected in clinical research [24]. Therefore, this survey aims to examine how women with and without a migrant background are informed and educated about bone health and the subsequent consequences of osteoporosis, including the sources of information most frequently used. The secondary aim is to investigate whether there are differences between migrant and non-migrant women regarding the use of preventive measures such as vitamin D intake and undergoing bone densitometry. We hypothesized the following: migration status could influence the level of knowledge and that migrants use preventive measures less often.\\nThe results of this investigation could form a basis to develop new ways of informing patients and informational concepts.\\nMethodology\\nThe patient survey data were collected in the following three locations in Berlin, Germany from March to June 2021: the Department of Gynecology with Center for Oncological Surgery Charité Campus Virchow Klinikum, Orthopedic Praxis Center Berlin, and at the Gynecologic Praxis Berlin Mitte.\\nA power analysis was conducted to estimate the sample size for demonstrating a difference between two groups: migrants and non-migrants. A sample size of 210 participants was required to detect with an effect size of 0.5, power\\u2009=\\u20090.95 size (alpha\\u2009=\\u20090.05, two-tailed test).\\nA total of 502 women were enrolled: 202 at the Department of Gynecology, Charité Virchow-Klinikum; 150 at Orthopedic Center Berlin; and 150 at Gynpraxis Berlin Mitte (Table\\xa01). Charité’s Berlin Ethics Committee approved the study (Reference number of ethics approval: EA4 / 02/21).\\nTable 1\\nStudy population divided into 3 locations where the patients were recruited\\nThe patients were given a patient information form and a questionnaire in German. Those aged 18 and over who could read the patient information and gave their informed consent to participate were included in the study. According to the ethics protocol, patient signatures were not required. This was to preserve anonymity on the informed consent form. The patient information form declared that by answering the questions, the respondent agreed to participate in this survey voluntarily, and the answers would be further analyzed and published. The questionnaire was answered anonymously. Therefore, no personal data that could directly identify a patient were gathered.\\nAll the eligible female patients who visited the three locations for medical treatment and had adequate German language skills were included consecutively and were approached by trained medical staff. Male patients and females under 18\\u2009years were not included. When women with a migration background had poor German skills, medical staff with the relevant foreign language skills was called in to translate. Those who did not speak German were not included in the study when a translator in the required language was unavailable.\\nThe survey consisted of 49 questions and was divided into three sections.\\nThe patients were asked about their origin, language, religion, and education level in the first part.\\nThe second section contained questions on general and gynecologic pre-existing diseases, lifestyle, physical activity, smoking, diagnostics, and treatments that had already been carried out. Finally, the third included assessing preventive measures such as vitamin D intake and knowledge of diagnostics about osteoporosis. The research questions were developed based on an interprofessional workshop between gynecologists, orthopedics and nurses and an intensive literature research. The aim of this survey was to collect data and generate a hypothesis as a basis for discussion and future strategies in patient care; not to develop and implement a new questionnaire. The comprehensibility was tested in a small group of 10 participants during a pilot phase. Therefore, no specific validation tests have been applied.\\nWe performed an inferential analysis to generate and test the hypothesis that migrant background may influence the willingness to take part in preventive measures such as undergoing bone densitometry and vitamin D intake. We performed a descriptive analysis to distinguish factors that influence the population’s level of knowledge about osteoporosis. We conducted different subgroup analyses comparing migrants from the first and second generations and patients with or without gynecologic cancer. For the purpose of our study we defined that a person has a migration background if they or at least one parent was not born with German citizenship, as suggested from Federal Statistical Office in Germany [25, 26]. Migrants born abroad are considered first generation and those born in Germany second-generation.\\nIn our study, the level of knowledge about preventive osteoporosis measures was calculated using a scale. After evaluating four questions from the questionnaire and their various positive and negative answer options, a 4-point scale was formed. The more positive answers the patients had, the more informed they were.\\nThe four questions are as follows:\\nThe evaluation was carried out according to the following scheme:\\nThe patient received one point in the survey for each positively answered question. If patients received more points when answering, it was assumed that they had a higher level of knowledge regarding bone health. Therefore, according to the number of positive answers, the patients were divided into 4 categories where 0 represented absent; 1, low; 2, moderate; and 3, a high level of knowledge.\\nThe data were evaluated using SPSS (version 24.0), a statistical data processing program. In addition to calculating the simple statistical values (absolute and relative frequencies), the Chi-Square Test was used to compare the relationship between two features. Furthermore, a binary logistic regression analysis was applied to independently check various influencing factors on vitamin D intake and on the probability of undergoing bone densitometry as a preventive measure. Finally, the impact of independent variables on the level of knowledge was evaluated using multivariate linear regression.\\nResults\\nDemographic data\\nA total of 502 patients were interviewed at the three locations, of which 65.3% (329) were non-migrants and 34.5% (173) were migrants. The latter represented first 26.1% (131) and 8.4% (42) second generation migrants. The proportion of migrants at the different locations was comparable: 36.7% at Gynpraxis Berlin Mitte, 38.0% at the Orthopedic Praxis Center Berlin, and 28.2% at the Department of Gynecology with Center for Oncological Surgery Charité Campus Virchow Klinikum (p\\u2009=\\u20090.103). The demographic characteristics of the patients from the three locations are summarized in Table \\u200bTable11.\\nThe average age was 46 for migrants and 53 for non-migrants (range 22-84). Both groups’ average body mass index was 25\\u2009kg/m2 (range 14.4 - 50.8\\u2009kg/m2). The number of high-school and university graduates was higher among migrants: 57% vs. 51%.\\nNon-migrant women are employed more frequently than migrant women (59% vs. 48% p\\u2009=\\u20090.00). When asked about religious affiliations, 48% of non-migrants vs. 18% of migrants said they had no religion. In 30.8% of migrant women, they stated Christianity as their religion, and 40.2% Islam. In contrast, only 1.8% of non-migrant women declared Islam as their religion, and 37.8% Christianity (Table\\xa02).\\nTable 2\\nDemographic data of the study population\\nRegarding the frequency and type of previous illnesses relevant to bone health, there are apparent differences between migrants and non-migrants. Non-migrants had secondary diseases (p\\u2009=\\u20090.05) more frequently such as obesity, underweight, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, thyroid diseases, rheumatic disease, and gynecologic tumor diseases compared to migrant women (Table \\u200b(Table22).\\nA positive family history of osteoporosis in the two groups (migrants and non-migrants) was indicated as 21%. In their personal medical history, 25% of the patients had suffered a fracture without trauma, and 18.5%, had had a fall.\\nLifestyle factors\\nWhen analyzing the lifestyle factors, it is noticeable that migrant women exercise less on a daily basis (59% vs. 65% - p\\u2009=\\u20090.39), smoke less (15.6% vs. 21% - p\\u2009=\\u20090.007) and consume significantly less alcohol (34.7% vs. 54.4% - p\\u2009=\\u20090.000) (Table \\u200b(Table22).\\nPreventive measures and sources of information\\nMost of the patients answered that the orthopedist (72%'}],\n",
