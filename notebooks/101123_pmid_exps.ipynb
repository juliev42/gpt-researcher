      "Epigenetic clocks and female fertility timeline: A new approach to an old issue?Letizia Li Piani1*  Paola Vigano'2 Edgardo Somigliana1,21Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, Università Degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy2Infertility Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca’ Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, ItalyWorldwide increase in life expectancy has boosted research on aging. Overcoming the concept of chronological age, higher attention has been addressed to biological age, which reflects a person’s real health state, and which may be the resulting combination of both intrinsic and environmental factors. As epigenetics may exert a pivotal role in the biological aging, epigenetic clocks were developed. They are based on mathematical models aimed at identifying DNA methylation patterns that can define the biological age and that can be adopted for different clinical scopes (i.e., estimation of the risks of developing age-related disorders or predicting lifespan). Recently, epigenetic clocks have gained a peculiar attention in the fertility research field, in particular in the female counterpart. The insight into the possible relations between epigenetic aging and women’s infertility might glean additional information about certain conditions that are still not completely understood. Moreover, they could disclose significant implications for health promotion programs in infertile women. Of relevance here is that the impact of biological age and epigenetics may not be limited to fertility status but could translate into pregnancy issues. Indeed, epigenetic alterations of the mother may transfer into the offspring, and pregnancy itself as well as related complications could contribute to epigenetic modifications in both the mother and newborn. However, even if the growing interest has culminated in the conspicuous production of studies on these topics, a global overview and the availability of validated instruments for diagnosis is still missing. The present narrative review aims to explore the possible bonds between epigenetic aging and fertility timeline. In the “infertility” section, we will discuss the advances on epigenetic clocks focusing on the different tissues examined (endometrium, peripheral blood, ovaries). In the “pregnancy” section, we will discuss the results obtained from placenta, umbilical cord and peripheral blood. The possible role of epigenetic aging on infertility mechanisms and pregnancy outcomes represents a question that may configure epigenetic clock as a bond between two apparently opposite worlds: infertility and pregnancy.1 IntroductionThe female reproductive timeline represents a shadowy and attractive topic of research. Albeit with individual variations and peculiarities, four milestones can be identified in the female reproductive lifespan: 1) menarche, corresponding to the beginning of fertile phase; 2) gestation, the fulfilment of the potential fertility; 3) the end of the fertile period occurring at about 10 years prior to menopause, and 4) menopause itself, marking the end of the ovarian hormonal activity and the onset of the senior age (te Velde and Pearson, 2002). The improved life expectancy and the social trend of postponing pregnancy have determined an increase in the average age of pregnant women, but also an increase in the rate of age-related infertility, boosting the interest on this topic (Mills et al., 2011; ESHRE Capri workshop group, 2017).In the aging research field, the concept of biological age has recently gained major attention since it may better reflect the real physiological status and function of an individual compared to chronological age (Lowsky et al., 2014). Epigenetics, defined as genome modifications that do not involve changes in DNA sequence but rather modifications of chromatin, is a crucial determinant of biological age (Bell et al., 2019; López-Otín et al., 2013). The growing awareness of the role of epigenetics in aging has encouraged the introduction of several estimators of biological age. Among them, epigenetic clocks have been heralded as the most accurate. It is possible that these clocks may glean additional information regarding fertility timeline, in which aging exerts a pivotal part. The possible impact of epigenetic aging on infertility mechanisms, but also the epigenetic modifications during gestation and the impact of pregnancy on a woman’s biological age are intriguing queries. Within an evolutionary framework, aging and reproduction are indeed intrinsically linked (Levine et al., 2018).The present narrative review considers the interaction between epigenetic clocks and fertility timeline. We mainly aimed to provide an overview of the knowledge gained on the role of epigenetic clocks in two apparent opposite faces of fertility, that is infertility and pregnancy. Table 1 summarizes the main features of the studies discussed in the present review. TABLE 1TABLE 1. Main characteristics of considered studies.2 Epigenetic clocksEpigenome has ushered a new era of molecular research in the field of aging (Erema et al., 2022) as DNA methylation (DNAm) has emerged as one of the most powerful strategies to predict chronological age (Horvath and Raj, 2018; Oblak et al., 2021; Simpson and Chandra, 2021). The precision of this instrument is astonishing, to the point to be used for forensic purposes to estimate chronological age in burned and defaced corpses or in biological specimens (Freire-Aradas et al., 2022). The availability of a precise predictive tool of chronological age can also allow to identify subjects whose chronological and biological age diverge and investigate the health consequences of this variation.DNA methylation refers to the addition of a methyl group to the 5’ end of DNA under the action of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), thereby affecting the regulation of gene expression. Usually, this modification occurs on cytosine (C)—phosphate (p)—guanine G) (CpG). A section of DNA rich in CpG in the genome is called a CpG island, with a length of 300–3,000 bp. CpG islands are usually located in the promoter region of the gene, so the CpG island of the gene promoter is a common location where methylation occurs. Approximately 70%–80% of the CpG in the human genome is methylated but its status can vary according to the aging process: CpGs undergo hypermethylation in the promoter regions, while they become hypomethylated in others (Saul and Kosinsky, 2021; Duan et al., 2022). DNAm can be measured by different methods: microarrays (Horvath et al., 2014), pyrosequencing (Zbieć-Piekarska et al., 2015), quantitative PCR and next-generation sequencing methods (Lu et al., 2018). Advances in microarray technology, biostatistics development and the emergence of a new open-access scientific mentality finally allowed the development of epigenetic clocks, the new metrics of biological age based on DNAm patterns (Horvath and Raj, 2018). Epigenetic clocks derive from machine learning models that automatically select the most informative CpGs by regressing (i.e., penalized, cox, elastic net regression model) a transformed version of chronological age on a set of CpGs (Horvath and Raj, 2018; Rutledge et al., 2022). Even if the large number of CpG included may be a guarantee of higher accurateness, a moderate number of CpGs could be robust enough, as epigenetic clocks depict comprehensive properties of the methylome (Duan et al., 2022). This notion has led to the development of simplified and less expensive epigenetic clocks.Epigenetic clocks may be based on one tissue (single-tissue clock) so that their accurateness is permitted only if applied on the tissue type on which they were trained (Hannum et al., 2013) or they could apply to all tissues and cell types across the entire duration of the human lifespan (multi-tissue clock) (Horvath et al., 2014; Levine et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2019). Huge differences in biological age exist among different tissues. The first multi-tissue predictor of age (Horvath Clock) was devised using n = 8,000 samples from 82 Illumina DNA methylation array datasets and encompassing n = 51 healthy tissues and cell types (Horvath et al., 2014). Since 2012, multiple models have spread throughout the world (Oblak et al., 2021; Shahal et al., 2022). While the first-generation clock goal was to be accurate in chronological age prediction (Horvath et al., 2014), the second ones aimed to investigate a possible causative role of DNAm in the ageing process and onset of age-related disorders (i.e., GrimAge, PhenoAge) (Levine et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2019). While GrimAge has been adopted for lifespan prediction, the PhenoAge clock could estimate cancer, or Alzheimer’s disease risk. A multitude of other clocks have spread for different clinical purposes (Levine et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2019; Johnstone et al., 2022). The possible difference between a person’s chronological age and the biological one, provided by epigenetic clocks, is defined as “age acceleration or deceleration”. If predicted DNAm age is greater than chronological age, age acceleration will be positive, if the predicted biological age is less than chronological one, it will be negative (decelerated age). While genetic and inner process could cause “intrinsic” age acceleration (Horvath and Raj, 2018), lifestyle and environmental factors may be detrimental for “extrinsic” one (Franzago et al., 2022). Not only epigenetic clocks may provide a clue on the impact of modifiable factors on the natural process of aging, but also they may give a glimpse of possible effective strategies to make the clock tick backwards (Levine et al., 2018). In fact, the growing awareness of the modulation role of nutrients and other food components on DNAm patterns has paved the way for new studies on the relationship between lifestyle interventions and epigenetic aging (Mathers et al., 2010; Horvath et al., 2014; Zannas et al., 2015; Quach et al., 2017; Franzago et al., 2022). Intriguingly, folates, a standard supplementation both in the pre-conception period and during early pregnancy, have been recently investigated in the aging field (Sae-Lee et al., 2018; Monasso et al., 2021; Nwanaji-Enwerem et al., 2021a). Chanachai Sae-Lest et al. observed that folic acid plus vitamin B12 intake can provide a different effect depending on MTHFR genotype, proving a decreased epigenetic age in women with the more common 677CC genotype (Sae-Lee et al., 2018). Owing to the relevance of the topic and its practical implications, these preliminary data corroborate the need for solid evidence. A description of the main features of most common clocks is provided in Figure 1.FIGURE 1FIGURE 1. Description of the characteristics of the most common epigenetic clocks.3 InfertilityThe worldwide trend toward delayed parenthood to the late thirties and even beyond has boosted the focus of reproductive medicine on the possible impact of aging on conceiving success (De Geyter et al., 2020). Women’s natural fertility sharply declines after 35 years and terminates at a median age of 41–42 years (Eijkemans et al., 2014). The subsequent 10 years until the advent of menopause are still characterized by ovulatory cycles, but the quality of the recruited oocytes is incompatible with live births (te Velde and Pearson, 2002). The lost of fertility is not due to a reduction of the remnant ovarian reserve but, conversely, to the deterioration of oocytes quality. Concepts like diminished ovarian reserve and ovarian aging have become “daily bread” for experts dealing with infertility issues. However, clarifying the real meaning of ovarian aging represents a worthwhile endeavor. In fact, despite the increasing number of studies on this topic, the exact biological changes occurring within ovaries overtime are not completely known. The current social trend for couples to delay childbearing has given more urgency to the need of investigating age rhythm and ‘ageing oocyte’ (Ge et al., 2015). Increasing literature has suggested that female reproductive timeline could be somehow punctuated by epigenetic mechanisms and clocks rhythm (Das and Destouni, 2022).One of the most stimulating theories supports a new concept of age-related infertility as the first sign of an “accelerated aging disease” (Llarena and Hine, 2021; Loose et al., 2022). In other words, ovaries could be the first compartment to show signs of a general process of accelerated aging. The result would be subfertility or even infertility. Thus, infertility could be remarked as part of a more general systemic illness that is defined by accelerated or premature aging process. Proving that infertility could be associated with age acceleration of a person’s biological clock may revolutionize reproductive medicine. Fertility status would no longer concern only couples desirous of offspring, but it could become a matter of global health, also involving the general practitioner who faces a young woman not yet seeking pregnancy. Prompt identification of women at higher risk of earlier exhaustion of fertility could provide them with a double opportunity: on one hand if it is a contemplated wish, they may have time enough for scheduling their family building plan; on the other one, they could prevent the raise of age-related disorders such as cardiovascular or bone health problems. A prompt family building plan could consist of two different chances: anticipating their offspring search time or overcoming the ageing process by freezing eggs or ovarian tissue.Not at last, biological aging biomarkers could glean additional information to traditional procreative testing (Morin et al., 2018; Monseur et al., 2020; Li Piani et al., 2022). Moreover, as at current state no consensus exists on whether the available traditional ovarian markers could be adopted for a large-scale screening of reproductive senescence, they could be evaluated for this purpose too. Noteworthy, the advantage of the availability of a measurement of ovarian biological age is not limited to a diagnostic purpose. It may also become a precious tool to predict the success of Assisted Reproductive Techniques (ART). Women with predicted compromised oocytes could indeed avoid embarking in the expensive, burdensome, and risky ART journey. They could be straightly advised for egg donation. Apart from these appealing potential clinical applications, studies on the topic are yet initial and insufficient. Available evidence is from here on reviewed, taking into consideration separately the endometrial, peripheral, and ovarian districts.3.1 Results from endometriumEndometrium is a unique dynamic tissue that cyclically sheds, rejuvenates, and endures complex modifications aimed to promote embryo implantation. However, uterine ageing is often left out of the picture of reproductive female timeline, so that few and contrasting data are available on age-related functional decline in the uterine tissues (Deryabin and Borodkina, 2022). Epigenetic mechanisms are however emerging as key players in regulating cyclic modulation of endometrium (Retis-Resendiz AM et al., 2021). The increase of the global acetylation of some histones (i.e., H3K9ac, H2AK5ac, H3K14ac, and H4K8ac) during the early proliferative phase may be supportive of the regeneration of the endometrial functional layer (Munro et al., 2010), while genes associated with transcription regulation (i.e., ID2, NFAM1, RUNX3, ZNF57) are more methylated in the secretory phase (Saare et al., 2016). In addition, gynecological diseases such as endometriosis may be linked to DNA methylation alterations (Leap et al., 2022). There is evidence of a perturbed biological age of the endometrium in affected women (Guo, 2009; Houshdaran et al., 2016; Saare et al., 2016) and altered speed of epigenetic clocks may predict the progression of some endometrial pathologies, including recurrent implantation failure and endometriosis (Deryabin and Borodkina, 2022).In 2013, Horvath reported that endometrial epigenetic age badly correlated with chronological one (cor = 0.55), (Horvath et al., 2014). In fact, when the multi-tissue Horvath clock was applied to healthy endometrium samples in the test data, the authors found an high error rate in the chronological age prediction, the endometrium being much younger based on epigenetic data (Horvath et al., 2014). However, Olesen et al. who specifically focused on the endometrium did not confirm this evidence (Olesen et al., 2018). Considering endometrial biopsies sampled at the same point in two consecutive cycles, these authors also described a good correlation between endometrial epigenetic and chronological age, as well as a modest inter-cycle variability. Endometrium was characterized by higher epigenetic acceleration (4.4 years higher than chronological age, p < 0.012) and no difference was detected across the different cycles. The authors also postulated that endometrial DNA methylation profile might change according to the phase of menstrual cycle (Olesen et al., 2018). In fact, the bad correlation found in Horvath’s work could derive from the insufficient attention given to the phase of the cycle for the assessment. However, the small sample size of the study of Olesen et al. (n = 9) hampers robust conclusions (Olesen et al., 2018). The cyclic variation of endometrium, its hormone-related nature, and the easy availability of samples all encourage deeper investigations to expand current understanding of the relation between DNA methylation and endometrial aging and function. The uterine factor still represents a neglected topic that should be part in the comprehension of age-related female fertility decline (Deryabin and Borodkina, 2022).3.2 Results from peripheral leukocytesMost common models have been validated on peripheral blood cells, and in particular in leukocytes. This font of DNAm was used to test the possibility that biological age, more specifically age acceleration, could better explain fertility decline variability than chronological age alone.In a pilot single-center cohort study, Monseur et al. evaluated the epigenetic age in the peripheral blood cells of 39 women undergoing ART. They used a modified Hovarth clock (they added some intergenic sites) to investigate whether age acceleration could be associated to fertility biomarkers (Monseur et al., 2020). They observed that not only chronological but also biological age negatively correlated with remnant ovarian reserve and oocytes yield. Women with age acceleration showed lower levels of anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) (1.29 vs. 2.29 ng/mL, p = 0.05), lower antral follicular count (AFC) (8 vs. 14.5, p = 0.05), lower number of oocytes retrieved (5.5 vs. 14.5, p = 0.002) and lower number of two pronuclear zygotes (3 vs. 7, p = 0.007), compared to the women without age acceleration. However, the design of this pilot study did not allow the authors to compare the predictive capacity of age acceleration with that of common biomarkers of ART success. Moreover, they could not disentangle whether age acceleration may provide independent information on the quality of the oocytes (Monseur et al., 2020). Apparently in contrast, Christensen et al. did not yield any indication of accelerated aging in n = 55 young women with idiopathic early ovarian aging (defined as: minimum two cycles with ≤5 oocytes obtained by ovarian stimulation with at least 250 IU recombinant FSH), when adjusting for chronological age (Christensen et al., 2021). However, the small sample size and the lack of adjustments for other variables (i.e., BMI, smoking) limit the value of the study.Another possible hypothesis postulates that the information provided by epigenetic clocks may go beyond ovarian reserve. In our latest project, we adopted Zbieć-Piekarska epigenetic model, that is set on five genes and based on pyrosequencing technique (Li Piani et al., 2022). In a group of n = 181 infertile patients aged 37–39 years, we could confirm that women who subsequently conceived and delivered after ART were epigenetically younger than those who did not (respectively: 36.1 ± 4.2 and 37.3 ± 3.3 years, p < 0.04). In contrast with Monseur et al. and Lee et al. (Monseur et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2022), we verified that adjusting for the variables that differed between the two groups (AFC, FSH, number of oocytes retrieved) the difference remained statistically significant (p = 0.028). Although these findings should be considered with caution for some aspects (restricted patients’ age, choice of the epigenetic model), they suggest that the contribution of epigenetic clocks may not be limited to reflect ovarian reserve. They may capture other aspects of reproductive health (Li Piani et al., 2022).In 2022, the role of age acceleration was investigated in a large population of pregnant women and using five different epigenetic aging clocks (DunedinPoAm, PhenoAge, DNAmTL, Hannum clock, Horvath Clock) (Lee et al., 2022). The authors considered a much greater sample size, comparing pregnant women conceiving naturally (n = 1,000) with those who conceived after ART treatment (n = 995 patients) (Lee et al., 2022). They noted that ART mothers aged 0.021 years faster than non-ART ones (p < 0.03), when the DunedinPoAm clock was adopted. They also found that the etiology of infertility might interplay with epigenetic clock behavior: women with tubal, anovulatory, or idiopathic infertility factor were epigenetically older than the non-ART counterparts (Lee et al., 2022). According to the authors, DunedinPoAm could surpass the other biomarkers in the field of reproductive medicine for its nature of “pace of aging” estimator. It is the only one that reflects aging pace from the time of sample to 10–15 years back and it is more sensitive to weigh environmental exposure burden. This large study stands out from the others as it has included fertile women as control group, it has recruited pregnant women, and it has pioneered novel epigenetic model. It has however some limitations. The authors did not report any information regarding the ovarian reserve, and, by study design, they excluded women with severe infertility that could not be overcome by ART. Finally, data could not be generalized to unpregnant women (Lee et al., 2022).3.3 Results from ovariesOvaries could be renamed as “women’s heart”, from a reproductive point of view. They are a time-limited forge of hormones and substances that are crucial for the general wellbeing. Follicular granulosa cells are responsible for the declining of ovarian steroid production associated with reproductive age and they are engaged in an intense crosstalk with the surrounding oocytes. Granulosa cells are crucial for supporting oocytes during follicular growth, maturation, and estrogen production. While epigenetic clocks have been widely validated on easily accessible tissues, their application to several other body regions including the ovaries has been quite limited. Intriguingly, Horvath clock performance seemed lower when tested on hormone-dependent tissues, such as endometrial and breast tissues (Horvath et al., 2014). More specifically, they resulted epigenetically older. Thus, it is not surprising that ovarian microenviroment has been attractive for studying epigenetic clock performance.3.3.1 Epigenetic aging patterns may be distinct in hormonally responsive tissuesThe first study that investigated ovarian epigenetic age in infertile women was published in 2018 (Morin et al., 2018). The authors applied the Horvath model to leukocytes and cumulus cells of women who underwent ART. They divided the enrolled subjects in four groups according to chronological age and ovarian response (A: young good responder; B: young poor responder; C: old good responder; D: old poor responder). They showed that the compartment of cumulus granulosa cells followed a different methylation trajectory with age compared to leukocytes: these cells resulted extremely younger, without difference among the groups for either chronological age or ovarian response. Not at last, they noted that this result was in line with a longer length of telomeres, which represents another valid aging biomarker. Overall, the results suggested a potentially distinct epigenetic timeline in the ovarian compartment. Inferences should however be drawn with caution since the sample size was not large (n = 77) and the authors could not include a control group of fertile women (Morin et al., 2018).Two years later, the same group sought to verify their results in a larger sample size, recruiting n = 175 women who were undergoing ovarian stimulation and divided into two groups (good responders: >5 oocytes retrieved, poor responders: <5 oocytes retrieved) (Hanson et al., 2020). To note, the definition of ovarian reserve was different compared to their previous work (Morin et al., 2018). The authors confirmed their previous observation: cumulus granulosa cells remained epigenetically younger than the chronological age (average 8.6 ± 2.1 vs. 35.3 ± 4.1 years) when Horvath model was applied. Going further, they attempted to generate an epigenetic model based on cumulus granulosa cell DNA methylation signature, but it turned out to be unsuccessful (Hanson et al., 2020).All these data also convey the idea that epigenetic aging patterns may be distinct in hormonally responsive tissues. As aforementioned before, Horvath model had a bad performance in case of endometrial tissues, that resulted epigenetically older (Horvath et al., 2014) or it could vary according to the intermenstrual period (Olesen et al., 2018). Cumulus granulosa cells resulted conversely epigenetically extremely younger, and the evidence of a higher telomere length, that is another common aging biomarker, comforted this finding (Morin et al., 2018; Hanson et al., 2020).3.3.2 Ovaries may work according to a different epigenetic clockGranulosa cells may reflect a different ageing process than other tissues: they are silent for decades, and then rapidly proliferate from 10–15 quiescent granulosa cells in primordial follicles to 60 million in the ovulatory phase. Given these premises, Olsen et al. postulated that ovarian compartment has a distinct epigenetic heritage than other somatic tissues (Olsen et al., 2018). The authors investigated the process of aging in mural granulosa cells, which are part of the follicular compartment (cumulus granulosa cells being those cells in close contact with the oocytes and mural granulosa cells being the main component of the follicular wall). Data from n = 118 women providing peripheral leukocytes and n = 59 women providing mural granulosa cells were tested using genome-wide methylation analyses (Olsen et al., 2018). Along with Horvath clock and Skin and Blood clock (Horvath et al., 2014; Horvath and Raj, 2018), a new epigenetic model (Granulosa Cell clock), developed by the same authors, was tested on mural granulosa cells (Olsen et al., 2018). As an upgrading of the popular Skin & Blood clock, the Granulosa Cell clock consisted of 296 CpG sites and yielded an improved correlation with chronological age of 0.85 (p = 4.3 × 10−34) when applied to leukocytes (Olsen et al., 2018). Mural granulosa cells were confirmed to be quite younger (an average of 2.7 years based on Horvath clock) (Olsen et al., 2018). The findings are mainly in line with those emerged from the study by Morin et al. (Morin et al., 2018). These latter authors also reported on cumulus granulosa cells and showed an average of 6.8 years based on Horvath clock and an average of 2.7 years based on Skin and Blood clock (Morin et al., 2018). In both studies, cumulus cells and mural granulosa cells epigenetic age did not reflect chronological age (Morin et al., 2018; Olsen et al., 2018). Besides, in mural granulosa cells, age acceleration difference was negative and the gap with chronological age was larger along with older age. To note, the rate of epimutations in terms of accumulation of DNA methylation errors was higher in advanced maternal age, but its entity was much more considerable in mural granulosa cells than in the corresponding peripheral leukocytes (p < 0.003) (Olsen et al., 2018).3.3.3 Ovarian epigenetic clock may also reflect the traditional concept of ovarian reserveOlsen et al. applied the Granulosa Cell and Skin & Blood clocks to verify whether epigenetic age could also depict the magnitude of a woman’s ovarian reserve (Olsen et al., 2018). A higher number of epimutations in terms of greater DNA methylation variability characterized mural granulosa cells of women with diminished ovarian reserve. More specifically, variability in epimutations involved AMH and IGF2 genes, both coding for proteins that are involved in folliculogenesis. These epimutations were also higher in advanced maternal age, suggesting that women with diminished ovarian reserve are similar to older women (Olsen et al., 2018).Symmetrically, Knight et al. proved a significant association between epigenetic age derived from granulosa cells and traditional ovarian reserve markers (Knight et al., 2022). The Grim Age clock was chosen as independent from chronological age, so that it could provide a unique perspective to evaluate oocyte competence. In a group of n = 70 women undergoing ART treatment, the GrimAge acceleration was negatively associated with AMH levels (p = 0.003), AFC (p = 0.0001), number of mature oocytes retrieved (p = 0.0003) and number of fertilized oocytes (p = 0.008) (Knight et al., 2022).These findings, however, deserve confirmation. Indirect findings from studies not designed to address this issue are less trenchant (Li Piani et al., 2022). In addition, one must weigh the clinical relevance.Overall, increasing literature has focused its attention on the application of epigenetic clocks to the different tissues of female reproductive organs. However, solid knowledge is not available yet and deeper investigations should be encouraged.4 PregnancyIt is not surprising that the world of pregnancy has been attractive for potential applications of epigenetic hallmarks too (Dieckmann et al., 2021). As a progress of the earlier fetal origin of adult diseases (FOAD) hypothesis (Barker, 2007), the Developmental Origins of Health and Diseases (DOHaD) theory establishes that the interaction at an early stage (from fertilization to early childhood) between genome and external factors (i.e., nutrition, stress, endocrine-disrupting chemicals) may be detrimental for non-communicable disease risk later in life (Arima and Fukuoka, 2020). These theories are based on the ‘developmental plasticity’ assumption, whereby organisms exhibit ‘plasticity’ to master an optimal fit between phenotype and environment, throughout critical developmental periods (Bateson et al., 2004). As this is a time-limited phenomenon, intrauterine “programming” has been the focus of several studies, where epigenetics has emerged as one of the most exciting themes (Bird, 2002; Hochberg et al., 2011). Prenatal and early postnatal periods represent windows of “epigenetic susceptibility” (Coussons-Read, 2013; Reimann et al., 2022).All these premises underscore the utility of epigenetic clocks to investigate “epigenetic programming” during the early developmental period, as epigenetic clocks are reliable epigenetic footprint. In case of advanced maternal age, epigenetic indices could capture unique signatures that go beyond the known higher rate of adverse newborns outcomes risk. Not only, in case of ART, the possible interference with the extensive epigenetic reprogramming in the early embryo could be disclosed by a change in the epigenetic gestational age acceleration (GAA) (Carlsen et al., 2022). Finally, the search of a solid marker for gestational age (GA) definition has become a research priority, as GA is crucial to forecast fetal maturity. Compared to traditional variables (i.e., last menstrual period (LMP), crown-rump length (CRL), or embryo transfer date (EDT) if conceptions are obtained with ART), epigenetic gestational aging could reveal a higher performance.Despite the interest that this area deserves, studies are underrepresented and what is lacking is a state of the evidence to date. In the following sections, we will discuss the results gathered according to the tissue included (placenta, cord-blood, peripheral blood) and finally the possible effects of pregnancy on mother’s epigenetic rhythm.Figure 2 shows a summary of findings regarding epigenetic patterns in case of the two mirrors of fertility time: infertility and pregnancy.FIGURE 2FIGURE 2. Epigenetic clocks and two mirrors of female fertility time. EAA: epigenetic age acceleration; ART: assisted reproductive technique; EA: epigenetic age; CC: cumulus cells; BC: blood cell; DOR: diminished ovarian reserve; CRL: crown-rump length; DGM: gestational diabetes.4.1 Results from placentaPlacenta is a highly specialized organ that orchestrates the whole course of pregnancy thanks to its multiple functions (i.e., gas and nutrients exchange, immunity transfer, hormone secretion), allowing the normal growth and development of the fetus. Conversely, placental pathology or dysfunction may be the origin of some high-risk pregnancies or fetal adverse events (Gude et al., 2004). It is reasonable that placental DNA methylation profile could provide information about how epigenetic variations ‘work under the skin’ during pregnancy to influence obstetric outcomes (Clark et al., 2022).Mayne et al. investigated the precise changes in DNA methylation that occur in the placenta across gestation and determined whether DNA methylation data could be used to predict the GA of a placenta (Mayne et al., 2017). Including placental tissue samples from 12 different datasets of only healthy singleton pregnancies (n = 387), the authors developed their placental GA calculator (DNAm GA) based on 62 CpG sites. The performance of DNAm GA sorted out excellent, with high correlation with the chronological age (p < 0.001) (Mayne et al., 2017). Starting from the results provided by Mayne et al., Lee et al. used a 6 times larger placental training set (n = 1,102) to create a new more robust placental clock, that could be well suited for GA estimation (Lee et al., 2019). Intriguingly, they also proved that placenta is quite distinct from other tissues regarding DNAm estimators’ application, observing no correlation between their placental GA model and other common epigenetic clocks (Lee et al., 2019). The reliability of these two models was also tested in a following sample of n = 427 placentas, founding an overall satisfactory accurateness and confirming the superiority of the model from Lee et al. (Lee et al., 2019) on the one by Mayne and coworkers (Mayne et al., 2017) (Dieckmann et al., 2021).Whether on one hand placental epigenetic clocks may be intriguing as a possible marker for GA estimation, on the other they could glean additional information in case of pregnancy-related complications. Indeed, it is feasible to speculate that a state of either maternal or fetal biological disorders may lead to disrupted placental epigenetic ageing, since it is the primary interface and balancing system between the maternal-fetal compartment in pregnancy.While Lee et al. proved that the DNAm GA performance was not impaired by common adverse conditions, the clock by Mayne et al. under/overestimated GA according to pregnancy conditions (Mayne et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2019). When comparing n = 70 placentas from preeclamptic pregnancies with n = 62 placentas from uncomplicated ones, Mayne et al. showed different methylation pattern in 741 CpG sites. They also underlined that only in case of early-onset preeclampsia, placentas were characterized by accelerated placental aging (p < 0.001) (Mayne et al., 2017). Systematic deviations of this clock might reveal interesting biological effects (Mayne et al., 2017). In fact, their result regarding preeclampsia is in line with the most supported theory according to which early preeclampsia may reflect a pathological distressed placenta, while late preeclampsia could be seen as the effect of a maternal status (Hales and Barker, 2001; Valensise et al., 2008; Staff, 2019). This result could be strengthened by an apparent opposite finding provided by Workalemahu et al. (Workalemahu et al., 2021) In n = 312 placentas, the authors found an association between placental epigenetic age deceleration with a lower cardiometabolic profile of the mother (pre-pregnancy BMI, gain of weight, maternal blood pressure). In multivariable-adjusted models, each 1 kg/week increase in their weight was significantly associated with 1.46 (95%CI: −2.61, −0.31), 1.70 (−3.00, −0.40), and 1.71 (−3.11, −0.32) week lower placental epigenetic age acceleration, for each trimester respectively. It could be indeed postulated that the placental immaturity, usually connected to maternal risk factors, may be reflected by an epigenetic deceleration. According to this vision, only early-onset preeclampsia would be characterized by placental age acceleration, and not the late-onset one, that is usually the consequence of maternal adverse profile and would be characterized by the opposite effect, such as age deceleration (Workalemahu et al., 2021).Moving forward, also sex-specific fetal growth differences and consequent early origins of neonatal and long-term health disparities have been explored also from an epigenetic point of view. Placental acceleration aging behavior differed in a sex-dependent manner (Dieckmann et al., 2021; Workalemahu et al., 2021), proving to be detrimental for fetal weight in males rather than in females (Mayne et al., 2017). Two different explanations could be plausible. First, it could be due to the higher in-utero energy demand in male fetuses. Alternatively, female fetuses may display a more efficient risk averse response against the ensuing accelerated aging (Mayne et al., 2017). It is also easily comprehensible that this relation is more manifest at later gestational periods that are typically distinguished by greater fetal oxygen and nutrients demand as well as higher oxidative stress (Tekola-Ayele et al., 2019). Considering n = 408 placentas from the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborns cohort, Clark et al. revealed differences according to maternal race. In fact, among infants born to black mothers, smoking during pregnancy was associated with higher placental GA acceleration than in other ethnic groups (+0.89 weeks, 95% CI: 0.38, 1.40) and with the duration of admission in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) (−0.08 days/weeks-GA, 95% CI: 0.12, −0.05) (Clark et al., 2022).All these data advocate the appropriateness of this novel approach to “old issues” like pregnancy disorders (Blair et al., 2013; Leavey et al., 2017). Nevertheless, some limits should be considered in on-going research. Attention should be addressed to the trimester considered. The DNAm GA proposed by Mayne et al. was based on I-II trimester healthy pregnancy, that could conceal later adverse events in III trimester (Mayne et al., 2017) while on the opposite way, the clock by Lee et al. may encompass some biases due to the training set based on III trimester (Lee et al., 2022). Not at last, as studies in twin pregnancies GA acceleration showed that heritability reached only 57%, environmental factors should be taken into account in the data analysis (Tekola-Ayele et al., 2019).4.2 Results from cord bloodCord blood could be a suitable model for DNA methylation study, as it contains stem cells, and changes in DNA methylation profile of stem cells are known to likely correlate with GA (Bocker et al., 2011).In 2016, Knight et al. adopted umbilical cord blood samples derived from n = 1,135 newborns to build an accurate neonatal predictor of GA (Knight et al., 2016). In the same year, from the Norwegian Mother and Child Birth Cohort (MoBa) study, Bohlin et al. confirmed the correlation between their prediction model derived by DNA extracted from n = 1,753 cord blood samples and GA based on CRL or LMP (Bohlin et al., 2016). In both studies, DNAm GA correlated more strongly with clinical GA estimates based on CRL than those based exclusively on LMP (Bohlin et al., 2016; Knight et al., 2016). However, this is expected since ultrasound is generally regarded as the most reliable method for GA estimation amongst practitioners. Not only, cord-blood epigenetic clocks proved to be more precise than those provided on placenta samples (Dieckmann et al., 2021). In fact, they observed higher correlation in DNAm GA provided by the cord-blood clocks (r = 0.77, p < 0.001) than by placental ones (r = 0.44, p < 0.001) (Dieckmann et al., 2021) and a superiority of the clock by Bohlin et al. on that by Knight’s group (Dieckmann et al., 2021; Daredia et al., 2022).In a prospective setting, Michaeli et al. designed a new robust epigenetic clock, based on n = 41 cord-blood samples, that showed high concordance with GA determined by common parameters (r = 0.77, p < 0.001) (Falick Michaeli et al., 2019). The groundbreaking feature of the work was the choice of reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) protocol for DNAm: it provides comprehensive genomic CpG coverage, it requires small amount of DNA and it guarantees a more cost-effectiveness than the 450 K array (Falick Michaeli et al., 2019).Haftorn et al. also developed a new epigenetic clock (EPIC GA) that outperformed both the previous clocks in terms of GA prediction accuracy (Haftorn et al., 2021). In fact, EPIC clock showed high precision in terms of prediction of GA (R2 = 0.724) with a median difference (MAD) of 3.24 days. Performance of clocks from Bohlin and Knight’s groups was lower (respectively: R2 = 0.610 MAD = 6.69 days; and R2 = 0.406 MAD = 4.55) (Bohlin et al., 2016; Knight et al., 2016).Besides, Haftorn et al. focused on the possible role of conception mode, comparing n = 200 newborns from natural conception with n = 838 ART ones. Although ART has been postulated to impair epigenetic signature, Haftorn et al. found no sharp different accuracy between epigenetic clocks set on CRL or ETD (Haftorn et al., 2021). Indeed, not only ART newborns were comparable to non-ART ones in terms of age acceleration, but a closer inspection in the specific ART procedure (ICSI vs. conventional IVF, fresh transfer vs. frozen transfer) did not show any significant variation (Haftorn et al., 2021).In n = 814 mother-child pairs, adopting clock by Knight et al. to cord-blood samples, Girchenko et al. found a correlation between newborns’ GA with some adverse maternal or obstetrics variables: maternal age of above 40 years at delivery, preeclampsia or fetal demise in a previous pregnancy, more than two pregnancy risk factors for preeclampsia or intra uterine growth restriction (IUGR). They showed that adverse maternal characteristics influence the newborn developmental stage and fetal organ and tissue maturation, determining variations in the offspring’s DNAm GA at birth (Girchenko et al., 2017). Conversely, the association of maternal age with newborn’s GA was not confirmed by Daredia et al. (Daredia et al., 2022). Indeed, the authors postulated that also negative acceleration (deceleration) of epigenetic gestational age could reflect either prenatal adverse conditions or developmental immaturity (Daredia et al., 2022), as aforementioned before (Workalemahu et al., 2021).All these findings are in line with the aforementioned DOHaD theory, according to which specific prenatal epigenetic perturbations of the “developmental programming” stage may have consequences during early life and cause accelerated aging (Simpkin et al., 2015; Reimann et al., 2022). Thus, cord blood DNAm GA could be a useful proxy for assessing developmental maturity (Javed et al., 2016). GA acceleration significantly predicted birthweight (p = 0.033) in the study of Knight et al. (Knight et al., 2016), consistent with the idea that DNAm GA may reflect general fetal maturity.Overall, placenta and cord blood seem quite distinct from other tissues regarding the development and application of DNAm-based age estimators. In clinical practice, one could envisage a plethora of applications: its usefulness for GA prediction could be especially foreseen in women who seek prenatal care late in their pregnancy or are unsure of LMP. As a proxy of fetal maturity, placental or cord-blood GA models could allow easier identification of the right treatment in case of preterm birth. Besides, it could be fruitful as a complemental clinical tool to recognize newborns that could benefit from additional monitoring and care.Nevertheless, cord-blood and placenta samples are not routinary collected before delivery. This aspect is not a matter of minority, as it would make the device currently unsuitable from a clinical point of view except after birth or confined to research purposes only. However, the presence of fetal cells in the maternal circulation is currently ascertained and may open the opportunity for new models based on cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA), making GA estimate potentially extremely accurate simply by collecting maternal blood samples at any time during pregnancy. Future studies should also focus on amniocytes obtained with amniocentesis because this is a more accessible and safer modality to obtain fetal cells.4.3 Results from maternal peripheral bloodThe bond between pregnancy and DNA methylation profile has been deeply investigated in mother and newborns’ peripheral blood. As fetal experience might permanently influence adult health through “developmental plasticity” (Hales and Baker, 2001; Wadhwa et al., 2009), it is not surprising that fetal birthweight has deserved a great attention. While at first it has been seen as an index of maternal nutrition, later, birthweight has gained the role of general intrauterine health proxy, due to the awareness that multiple factors can influence it (Rondó et al., 2003; Grote et al., 2010). Ross et al. were the first to describe an inverse association between second trimester maternal GrimAge acceleration and gestational length or birthweight (Ross et al., 2020). As part of a longitudinal study designed to test the impact of antenatal maternal mood on pregnancy and postpartum outcome (Healthy Babies Before Birth HB3), Ross et al. described the association between GrimAge profile of n = 77 women at their II trimester and newborns’ birthweight and length. The significant correlation between an increase of mothers’ GrimAge acceleration and lower newborns’ birthweight (p = 0.001) highlights the potential role of maternal biological aging on birth outcomes. The authors themselves however underline the possible selection bias due to the recruitment of low-risk pregnancies as well as the lack of validation of epigenetic indices in pregnancy (Ross et al., 2020).Madden et al. corroborated their results, presenting a significant relation between low birthweight and GrimAge acceleration (Madden et al., 2021). Based on a Scottish family-based cohort, the authors conducted an epigenome-wide study of birthweight using whole blood DNA derived from n = 1,757 adult samples. Among the five adopted epigenetic models (Horvath clock, Hannum, PhenoAge, GrimAge, DNAmTL), only GrimAge and DNAmTL revealed a significant increase of epigenetic age along with low birthweight (Madden et al., 2021). The authors postulated that while DNAmTL could reflect aging phenomenon at a cellular level, GrimAge could describe this aspect at a whole-body level. Finally, they could state that GrimAge outperforms the other models in the framework of pregnancy (Madden et al., 2021). To note, results by Madden et al. regarding DNAmTL are in contrast with previous works that excluded a role of telomere system in birth outcome (Akkad et al., 2006) and with data from Ross et al., where DNAmTL seemed independent from birthweight (Ross et al., 2020).Symmetrically, extremely low birth weight (ELBW≤1,000 g) could provide a model from nature for how early adversity may shape adult phenotypes (Saigal et al., 2020). Adopting Horvath clock to n = 45 ELBW and n = 47 normal birthweight (NBW) adult survivors, Mathewson et al. observed that ELBW survivors had 2.16 epigenetic years more than their NBW peers for each additional adult risk factor (i.e., BMI, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, blood pressure) (Mathewson et al., 2021). The association between epigenetic age and cumulative risks was characterized by an increasing degree over time, reaching higher significance at their 40s (Mathewson et al., 2021). Their numbers supported the idea that extreme perinatal adversity, such as ELBW, may cause perturbations in the “epigenetic maintaining system” and influencing the “developmental plasticity” in a negative way. However, further considerations are limited for some reasons: the reduced sample size, the single time-point nature of the study that does not allow assessment of dynamic changes in epigenetic aging, the missed choice of second-generation models that may be more appropriate for the purpose (Mathewson et al., 2021).In other projects, epigenetic rhythm disturbances have been exploited as a potential mechanism linking maternal gestational diabetes (GDM) with offspring’s metabolic risk in later life. In a study set on mother-child pairs (n = 1,156), Shiau et al. adopted Horvath and Hannum clock to verify whether offspring exposed to GDM exhibited accelerated epigenetic ageing in their early childhood, compared to those not exposed (Shiau et al., 2021). Even after adjustment for potential confounders, offspring age acceleration remained higher in the GDM group than in the non-GDM group (according to Horvath clock: +4.96 months higher, p = 0.0002; Hannum clock: +11.2 months, p < 0.0001) (Shiau et al., 2021). Similarly, even if in a smaller sample, Kanney et al. examined the association of epigenetic acceleration with five metabolic biomarkers of interest and GDM (Kanney et al., 2022). In a total of n = 137 mother-child dyads in the Health After Pregnancy - Intergenerational Transmission of Obesity (HAPi) study, the authors compared the result provided by Hannum and Horvath clock in mothers with a prior GDM pregnancy and those without. They could show not only a higher mean epigenetic age in GDM group than in the non-GDM one, but also that among the biomarkers evaluated (leptin, HOMA IR, HDL C, fasting glucose), a statistically significant association was registered between HDL-C and epigenetic age acceleration residuals for the Hannum clock (p = 0.0063) in GDM mothers (Kanney et al., 2022). Both these studies showed the effect of a suboptimal prenatal developmental milieu of the offspring and go along with other data that supported a possible impact of hyperglycemia on developmentally crucial genes (i.e., energy metabolism, metabolic regulation), causing persistent epigenetic changes (Bouchard et al., 2012; Reichetzeder et al., 2016). Nevertheless, additional investigation across the life course using longitudinal samples is warranted (Shiau et al., 2021).4.4 Transgenerational effectsMoving further and going beyond DOHaD theory, the starting point of ageing process could be placed even before intrauterine lifetime and it could be postulated that the “epigenetic programming and plasticity” could be shaped by maternal experience, even before becoming mother. Adverse child events (ACE) refer to negative psychosocial experiences that individuals experience during the first 18 years of life, that can span from abuse, household dysfunction and neglect (Felitti et al., 1998). There is consistent evidence that ACE could cause important consequences in later health life and a consequent hypothesis formulates a possible intergenerational effect, in part due to epigenetic inheritance (Deschênes et al., 2021). In other words, it is possible that events in the mother’s childhood could have effect during pregnancy and more specifically on her future newborns’ outcomes. Nwanaji-Enwerem et al. verified whether preconception maternal ACE could cause stress-related physiologic reprogramming that might result in child health changes, causing intrinsic epigenetic acceleration age, due to intergenerational effects (Nwanaji-Enwerem et al., 2021b) (Figure 3). Describing ACEs experienced by mothers during their childhood and epigenetic aging of their children at 7, 9, and 14 years, Nwanaji-Enwerem et al. showed that children exposed to adverse events were 0.76-year older than children of mothers who did not report these events, in terms of Horvath epigenetic age acceleration (p = 0.004) (Nwanaji-Enwerem et al., 2021a). These findings are the first to exploit the relation between early mother life and epigenetic consequences on their children, and they can provide a molecular basis for the perpetuation of health disparities over time in marginalized populations (Nwanaji-Enwerem et al., 2021b). These data agree and indeed go beyond the results provided by George et al., who showed an influence of social disadvantage exposure in childhood on the biological ageing during adulthood (George et al., 2021). In a cohort of 53-year-old n = 1,376 adults, George et al. exhibited that disadvantaged childhood and lower adult socioeconomic positions were characterized by an accelerated aging process according to GrimAge estimator (p < 0.001) (George et al., 2021).FIGURE 3FIGURE 3. The transgenerational effect of epigenetic pattern. The black arrow and black clock represent the chronological time rhythm, that is linear and straight. The red arrow and red clock stand for epigenetic age with a non-linear way of proceeding, with acceleration and decelerated slopes. The blue arrow figures the possible impact of mother’s past adverse events (even in childhood) on the future newborn’s health.However, another explanation to the data published by Nwanaji-Enwerem et al. may be provided by Herrero-Roldán et al. (Herrero-Roldán et al., 2021). Comparing n = 87 mothers with n = 50 women characterized by “neglect attitude” towards their newborns (neglect group NG), the authors observed that the NG was typically composed by women who have had a disadvantaged background: a higher number of pregnancies in particular at younger age, lower education level, greater childhood maltreatment, propensity for psychiatric disorder, and more economic difficulties. Besides, the authors observed that NG was 2 years epigenetically older than the control group, applying PhenoAge estimator to the collected buccal samples (Herrero-Roldán et al., 2021).Thus, data from Nwanaji-Enwerem et al. could be justified by two different hypotheses. On one hand, as women with ACE are characterized by epigenetic accelerated age (Herrero-Roldán et al., 2021), their newborns could inherit this disadvantaged epigenetic profile. On the other one, it is also likely that women with ACE experiences are at higher risk of adopting neglect attitude towards their newborns (Herrero-Roldán et al., 2021), causing a prenatal or neonatal adverse environment that would be detrimental for the newborns’ developmental maturity and the cause of their epigenetic acceleration profile.To sum up, epigenetic clocks further underscore the urgence of providing timely and effective mental health support to vulnerable populations, especially during pregnancy. These last papers illustrate how the mother’s mental health state, that has been mostly “neglected”, can influence the quality of the prenatal environment and consequent multiple aspects of child development (McGill et al., 2022).4.5 Epigenetic effect of pregnancy on motherAs epigenetic clocks have been exploited to detect the impact of pregnancy and maternal characteristic on obstetric and newborns’ outcomes, the possibility that pregnancy may have consequences on maternal health status has raised the interest in epigenetic age behavior, too. In a very preliminary work (n = 33 women), Carroll et al. investigated the effect of sleep deprivation in the postpartum phase and on the biological clock (Carroll et al., 2021). Applying Horvath clock and PhenoAge estimator to peripheral blood samples, they observed that insufficient sleep duration during the early postpartum period was associated with accelerated biological aging (p = 0.03 and p = 0.001 with Horvath and PhenoAge) (Carroll et al., 2021). It is not hard to believe a possible trade-off between reproductive effort and life expectancy (Bolund et al., 2016). Reproductive effort could change brain structures involved in the sociability required for parenting, likely influencing both mAge acceleration and lifespan (Nishitani et al., 2022). Based on a cohort of n = 51 mothers aged 27–46 years, Nishitani et al. explored the relation between epigenetic age and the regional gray matter volumes measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They noted that multiparity (less than four newborns) encompasses a process of mAge deceleration (p = 0.02) and that precuneus volume increases as mAge deceleration occurred. However, their findings should be considered in the context of some limitations. Saliva samples did not let the adoption of second-generation epigenetic clock, and nulliparous women should be included in future studies to confirm their results (Nishitani et al., 2022). On the other hand, this study opens new fascinating scenarios. This proof could represent the molecular description of the dynamic structural and functional phenomena during pregnancy, linked to “maternalization” of the brain (Hoekzema et al., 2017; Luders et al., 2020) and could give the clarification of longer life expectancy in child-rearing mothers (less than four children) according to demographic studies.Evidence is however not univocal. In a cohort of n = 397 20–22-year-old women, Ryan et al. also described a raise of DNAmAge acceleration with parity (p = 0.005), consistent with the idea that reproduction comes at a cost of ‘maintenance’ and that epigenetic biomarkers could reflect this “stress” (Ryan et al., 2018). However, they failed to detect an increase of DNAmAge in case of low socio-economic status, a robust “stressor”, even if they justified it as a plausible effect of young age compensation. The narrow age range chosen could indeed introduce some biases (Ryan et al., 2018) that may explain at least in part the difference with previous works (Nishitani et al., 2022).Gestational epigenetic age clocks are still in their nascent stages. Given that pregnancy emphasizes unique and dynamic physiological adaptations across physiological systems, epigenetic clocks should be validated in pregnant samples. Besides, even if the set cohort homogeneity provides robustness to epigenetic indices, further validation is mandatory in larger and more heterogenous samples to guarantee its generalizability.5 Conclusion and future directionsIn this review, we mainly discussed the possible role of epigenetic clocks in the female reproductive health, starting with physiological fertility issues but then inevitably encompassing the linked topics of infertility and pregnancy. The role and mechanisms of aging in female reproductive lifespan has just recently gain scientific attention but multiple aspects are still neglected.Epigenetic clocks represent a promising research tool for the coming years and may bring us closer than ever to understanding the complexities of reproductive function. It is reasonable that exploiting epigenetic mechanisms may help advance inquiry into the relation between fertility time and aging. In case of infertility, clinical practice could take advantage of epigenetic biomarkers. Biological age could become a precious information in the diagnostic fertility work-up. Women affected by an “accelerated aging” process could be promptly addressed to adequate health promotion programs and provided with the awareness of “family plan” urgency, if it is a desired wish (Figure 4). Similarly, oocyte or ovarian tissue freezing may not only relegated as “social freezing”, but this choice could be part of health promotion and prevention medicine programs, even in those countries where elective egg freezing is limited to small subgroups of women at high risk of ovarian reserve exhaustion such as those scheduled for radio or chemotherapy.FIGURE 4FIGURE 4. Future directions.Regarding pregnancy, epigenetic clocks have the merit of opening a new vision to old arguments. Pregnancy may be not confined to a restricted time window for a woman’s life, but may deserve higher consideration for the whole life. The possibility that environmental exposure could deeply impact on epigenetic footprints and determine the epigenetic rhythm of ageing could renovate the way of dealing with pregnancy issues too. Epigenetic clocks may serve as screening tool for high-risk pregnancies, and they may foster improvement of pregnancy outcomes and postpartum wellbeing. Not only, but it could represent a new tool for dealing with social disparities and help the support of “vulnerable” pregnant populations. Then the future development of GA estimator based on fetal free DNA in maternal blood could completely revolutionize even the prenatal medicine. Whether these epigenetic patterns are stable or shift over the course of reproductive female life represents another key point in the knowledge that may unveil pragmatic therapeutic approach to “turn back the clock” in (a very) distant future. Last, but not least, there is the need to explore more in depth the possible impact of a history of infertility and ART on the epigenetics of newborns.Future research should explore the unique epigenetic mechanisms underlying aging, that may play a role in the infertility and the obstetric world, with all the possible consequent implications. Finally, it is important to emphasize that pregnancy and infertility may not be seen as two different “worlds” but could represent “chapters” of a same story, whose red thread is the epigenetic rhythm.Author contributionsLP designed the review and wrote the first draft of the manuscript; LP drew the figures and tables; PV and ES revised and corrected the manuscript.

Fractures cause increases in morbidity and mortality and have a significant financial impact on the healthcare system and society\\nAddressing risk factors for osteoporosis early may prevent or delay the onset of fractures and use of drugs. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may benefit people with a high risk of deficiency (e.g. institutionalised older people) but may not be required in people without risk factors. Impact and resistance exercises and physical activity can increase bone density and prevent falls\\nAntiresorptive drugs such as bisphosphonates and denosumab remain first-line treatment options for osteoporosis. The ongoing need for bisphosphonates should be assessed after five years and treatment may then be interrupted in some patients. Progressive bone loss will recur slowly. Denosumab therapy should not be interrupted without switching to another therapy, as post-treatment bone loss can progress rapidly. All patients will need ongoing monitoring and most will require some long-term therapy once started\\nRaloxifene may be considered in women who do not tolerate first-line antiresorptive drugs. Romosozumab is a new anabolic treatment for osteoporosis and, together with teriparatide, is subsidised as second-line therapy for individuals with severe disease and multiple fractures. Specialist referral should be considered for patients who sustain fractures while undergoing osteoporosis therapy\\nIntroduction\\nOsteoporosis is a common musculoskeletal disease in older people characterised by a progressive loss in bone mineral density and microarchitectural deterioration. In Australians aged over 50 years, 40–60% of women and 25–30% of men will experience a minimal trauma fracture in their lifetime.1 Fractures cause pain, disability and a reduced quality of life,2 and are associated with an increased re-fracture rate. Fractures lead to a five-year mortality rate of 25%, which increases to up to 50% in the event of a re-fracture.3 The population-attributable mortality risk associated with fractures in Australians aged 45 years and over has been found to be similar to that associated with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, highlighting the need to identify and treat osteoporosis.4\\nOsteoporosis is a silent disease before a fracture occurs, so the exact prevalence is hard to determine. Even after diagnosis, it is often undertreated, with approximately 25% of Australian patients with osteoporosis having no history of receiving osteoporosis medicines.5\\nOsteoporosis risk assessment\\nThere are a number of non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors, diseases and drugs associated with osteoporosis and minimal trauma fractures. The fracture risk for an individual can be accurately predicted using the Garvan Fracture Risk or FRAX calculators.6,7 Age, a family history of hip fractures and previous fractures are key risk factors. All men and women over the age of 50 years who have sustained a fracture have a higher risk of subsequent fractures and should be assessed and considered for treatment. Bone mineral density testing is also recommended and subsidised for all men and women over 70 years of age. Along with falls-risk screening, it is recommended as part of general health checks for all individuals, yet medical record audits indicate that this prevention strategy is currently underused.8\\nOsteoporosis can be defined using bone mineral density testing, which generates a T-score and Z-score. The T-score reflects the number of deviations from the peak bone mass of age-, sex- and ethnicity-matched norms. A T-score less than –2.5 indicates a significant reduction in bone mass. The Z-score reflects the number of standard deviations from the average bone mass of age-, sex- and ethnicity-matched norms. A Z-score less than –2.0 should prompt a more complete search for secondary causes of osteoporosis.\\nManagement strategies\\nAddressing lifestyle risk factors, appropriately treating predisposing conditions and minimising the unnecessary prescription of drugs associated with osteoporosis may slow the decline in bone density and prevent minimal trauma fractures. Some modifiable risk factors are summarised in the Box.9 Various management strategies can help decrease the risk of osteoporosis or delay its onset.\\nBox\\nExercise\\nExercise throughout a person’s lifetime can delay the onset of osteoporosis. Exercise in children and adolescents is strongly associated with a higher peak bone density in adulthood. This effect is seen most with high-impact exercises such as hopping, skipping and jumping.10 Even an increase in leisurely physical activity can cause a durable increase in bone mass that can persist into early old age.11 In older people, low-impact exercises such as walking and swimming may slow the decline in bone mass, whereas higher impact exercises, resistance exercises, and combinations of different types of exercises may increase bone density.12-15\\nThe frequency and severity of falls may also be reduced by exercise programs, such as Stay On Your Feet and Stepping On. The main benefits are seen with programs focused on balance and function, or programs that involve multiple types of exercise (e.g. balance exercise plus resistance exercise).16 Where possible, individuals are encouraged to perform a combination of weight-bearing, resistance and balance exercises. Information regarding the types of exercises that can be recommended is available from the Healthy Bones Australia fact sheets.\\nCalcium\\nAdequate calcium concentrations are crucial to prevent bone loss and fractures. The recommended dietary intake of calcium is 1000–1300 mg per day, depending on age and sex. Common calcium-rich foods include dairy products, chickpeas, beans, sardines and tofu. A dietary calcium calculator is available on the International Osteoporosis Foundation website.\\nMost older Australians do not achieve the recommended dietary intake of calcium. Along with information and guidance on dietary modifications, daily supplements of 500–600 mg are sometimes needed for these people. Calcium supplementation, particularly with vitamin D, can reduce the rate of bone loss and fractures in people who are deficient in calcium such as frail elderly people.17\\nThere is conflicting evidence regarding oral calcium supplementation and the risk of major adverse cardiac events, which include myocardial infarction and stroke. Recent meta-analyses on cardiovascular disease risk have revealed a range from a 10% relative risk reduction to a 15% relative risk increase.18-20\\nVitamin D\\nVitamin D is important for the absorption and use of calcium in the body. Evidence suggests about a third of Australians have vitamin D deficiency.21 While small amounts of vitamin D are absorbed through food, most is received from direct sunlight. Those with fair skin require 6–7 minutes of mid-morning or mid-afternoon sun exposure outdoors during the summer and up to 30 minutes during the winter to maintain adequate concentrations of vitamin D. People with darker skin will require 3–6 times the length of exposure. Additionally, window glass, full-coverage clothing and sunscreen inhibit the transmission of ultraviolet B radiation and thus vitamin D synthesis in the skin. Vitamin D synthesis is also less efficient in older people.22 Improving vitamin D concentrations reduces the risks of falls and fractures in older people,23,24 particularly when combined with adequate calcium concentrations.17,25\\nRoutine vitamin D supplementation for primary prophylaxis is not recommended for community-dwelling adults.26 Those who have risk factors or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency should have their vitamin D concentrations measured. These are ideally measured in late winter or early spring, when serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are the lowest. Optimal mineral metabolism, bone density and muscle function are achieved when serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are greater than 50 nanomol/L. If testing is carried out in late summer, the concentration should be 10–20 nanomol/L higher.\\nPatients with vitamin D deficiency should start supplementation (Table 1). Routine vitamin D and calcium supplementation reduces the risks of falls and fractures in people with established osteoporosis or institutionalised people.17 There are very few adverse effects related to oral vitamin D supplementation. When combined with calcium, there is a small risk of hypercalcaemia, nephrolithiasis and gastrointestinal symptoms.\\nTable 1\\n* Alternatively, higher doses may be given less frequently when needed.\\nDrugs for osteoporosis\\nPharmacotherapy is indicated for individuals with a significantly increased risk of fractures. First-line treatment is available under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for:\\nAntiresorptive therapy can reduce the risk of fractures by up to 50%. There is a consensus to treat individuals who have a hip fracture risk of more than 3% or any fracture risk of more than 20% over 10 years.9 However, treatment for this indication alone is not subsidised under the PBS. There should be a shared discussion taking a patient’s fracture risk, preferences and costs into consideration, although many drugs such as bisphosphonates are inexpensive.\\nBefore starting drugs for osteoporosis, ensure that all patients have adequate vitamin D and calcium concentrations and that any secondary causes for osteoporosis have been managed. Table 2 summarises the common and notable rare adverse effects of different osteoporosis treatments.\\nTable 2\\n* Risk factors include dental extractions, implants, poorly fitting dentures, pre-existing dental disease, glucocorticoid use and smoking.\\n† Risk factors include rheumatoid arthritis, increased femoral bowing, thicker lateral cortices at the femoral shaft and Asian ethnicity.\\nBisphosphonates\\nBisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activation and prevent bone resorption. They slow the rate of bone loss, improve bone mineral density and reduce both hip and vertebral fractures. Alendronate, risedronate and zoledronic acid are currently available for osteoporosis in Australia. Head-to-head evidence for bisphosphonates is lacking. At the time of publication, bisphosphonates are cheaper than other drug treatments.\\nOral and intravenous bisphosphonates are contraindicated in patients with renal impairment and should be avoided if the estimated glomerular filtration rate is less than 35 mL/minute/1.73 m2.27\\nSafety data are robust for the use of oral bisphosphonates up to five years and intravenous bisphosphonates up to three years.28 The fracture risk should then be re-assessed, and most specialists normally extend treatment if the patients fall under any of the following high-risk categories:\\nOral and intravenous bisphosphonates can be extended up to 10 and six years, respectively, without an increase in adverse events compared to placebo.28-34 Treatment extension in these high-risk populations has been shown to be effective in preventing new vertebral fractures, but minimally beneficial for preventing hip fractures. Patients at lower risk have not been shown to experience more clinical fractures after stopping therapy due to the durable effects of bisphosphonates.28-34 If therapy is stopped, the fracture risk is generally re-assessed in 2–3 years or upon re-fracture to consider restarting therapy.\\nOral bisphosphonates\\nAlendronate and risedronate are inexpensive and have once-weekly or once-monthly oral dosing. It is important to counsel patients to take oral bisphosphonates in the morning on an empty stomach with a full glass of water and to remain upright for 30 minutes after ingestion to ensure adequate drug absorption and prevent erosive oesophagitis. The main limitations of oral bisphosphonates are their upper gastrointestinal effects. Dysphagia, achalasia or an inability to remain upright for 30 minutes after tablet ingestion are absolute contraindications. They should also be used with caution in patients who have previously undergone upper gastrointestinal or bariatric surgery, as this may impair drug absorption and increase the risk of adverse events.\\nIntravenous bisphosphonates\\nZoledronic acid is an intravenous bisphosphonate given as an annual infusion. It can help overcome the gastrointestinal limitations of oral formulations, but it has other potential adverse effects, most notably the risk of flu-like reactions following infusions. Myalgias and arthralgias can also occur and may be prolonged. Patients with renal impairment can be at greater risk of these reactions, and in such cases, the infusion rate could be reduced. Alternatively, a different class of drug that is not affected by renal function, such as denosumab, should be considered. There is also a small risk of atrial fibrillation and uveitis with intravenous zoledronate. Bisphosphonates have been associated with the rare and serious adverse events of atypical femoral fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw.\\nDenosumab\\nDenosumab is a monoclonal antibody that reversibly inhibits bone resorption by reducing osteoclast formation and differentiation while increasing osteoclast apoptosis. It increases bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and hip and reduces the risk of fractures. Denosumab is administered as a six-monthly subcutaneous injection. In contrast to bisphosphonates, denosumab can be used in patients with chronic kidney disease. However, these patients are particularly at risk of hypocalcaemia, so baseline concentrations of calcium and vitamin D should be assessed before starting therapy.\\nPatients should either continue denosumab indefinitely or be transitioned to an alternative treatment drug (e.g. bisphosphonates) for at least 12 months on discontinuation. Unlike bisphosphonates, the effect of denosumab is not durable and is rapidly reversible after cessation.35 Stopping denosumab or missing doses is associated with an increased risk of atraumatic vertebral fractures.35-39 The incidence of these fractures has been reported to be between 7% and 10%, with more patients sustaining multiple vertebral fractures compared to patients who have not received denosumab.35-38 These rebound effects can be seen as early as seven months after the previous dose and can persist for two years following discontinuation.38,39\\nBisphosphonates such as alendronate and zoledronic acid appear to be effective in minimising the bone loss and mitigating the increased fracture rate associated with denosuma'},\n",

Identification of the knowledge about osteoporosis and its preventive methods is the backbone of any awareness program. This study investigates the knowledge with a special focus on women with and without a migration background.\\nMethods\\nData from systematic patient interviews based on a questionnaire were collected at three different sites in Berlin between February and June 2021. The survey included questions assessing migrant background, demographic characteristics, lifestyle habits including physical exercise and smoking, prevention by vitamin D intake and bone densitometry, and information on personal and family medical history. According to the responses, a scale was created to assess the level of knowledge of preventive osteoporosis measures. The ethic committee of the Charité, Medical faculty has approved this study. SPSS (version 24.0) was used for the statistical analyses.\\nResults\\nThe survey of 502 female patients revealed that 25% had low and 34% no previous knowledge of osteoporosis. Older age and a better education level correlate with a higher knowledge. Patients with gynecologic cancer are less well informed. There is a significant difference in vitamin D intake between migrant and non-migrant women (57% vs. 49%). There were no significant differences regarding the use of bone densitometry.\\nConclusion\\nKnowledge of osteoporosis and the possibility of a bone densitometry as well as the implementation of preventive measures is low among women. Therefore, informing patients better should be a priority, with particular attention on the risks and needs of women with a migration background. Specific programs for women with and without migration background should be developed to increase the awareness of osteoporosis.\\nIntroduction\\nOsteoporosis is a disease of the skeletal system associated with a loss of bone mass and an increased risk of fractures.

This leads to a significant impact on patients’ quality of life and high costs for the health care system [3]. With increasing life expectancy, the number of elderly individuals is rising and the incidence of worldwide burden of fragility fractures is estimated to rise [4, 5]. Strategies to reduce this burden are needed by identifying individuals at risk and by increasing awareness of osteoporosis. The FRAX algorithm for example is a model, which enables the estimation of the patients’ absolute risk of fracture over the next 10\\u2009years [6].\\nAnother important strategy as mentioned above is to increase patient awareness of osteoporosis risk factors by increasing their knowledge to encourage them to take preventive measures and to improve compliance with therapy [7].\\nLifestyle factors such as smoking, high alcohol consumption, or lack of exercise also play a significant role in bone quality [8, 9]. Positive family history, vitamin D deficiency, reduced calcium intake, underweight (BMI <\\u200920), and age are discussed as additional risks for increased fracture rates [10–13]. There is clear evidence such as increasing physical activity, cessation of smoking, adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium may reduce the risk of osteoporosis [14].\\nAwareness of such risks and the options for primary prevention is essential in reducing the incidence of osteoporosis. Several studies [15–17] have examined the association between knowledge of osteoporosis and preventive behavior. Some of them have shown that the level of knowledge could improve the use of preventive measures such as increasing exercise and calcium intake [18]. In addition, there are only few studies, that have used a validated tool to measure the knowledge of osteoporosis such as the following: Osteoporosis Knowledge Assessment Tool (OKAT) used for a survey in the Australian population [19]; the Osteoporosis Assessment Questionnaire, or OPAQ for postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis [20].\\nBased on our information, no similar studies have researched the level of knowledge of osteoporosis within migrants and non-migrants.\\nSpecific frail groups in society, such as women with a migrant background seem to be confronted with significantly more impediments for taking up preventive measures and should therefore be specially considered [21]. Language barriers, poor working conditions, and low social status could increase the health risks for many migrant women [22, 23]. Increasing migration due to crisis situations in Europe and worldwide has led to ethnical and socio-cultural diversity in society and in health systems. These cohorts of patients should be reflected in clinical research [24]. Therefore, this survey aims to examine how women with and without a migrant background are informed and educated about bone health and the subsequent consequences of osteoporosis, including the sources of information most frequently used. The secondary aim is to investigate whether there are differences between migrant and non-migrant women regarding the use of preventive measures such as vitamin D intake and undergoing bone densitometry. We hypothesized the following: migration status could influence the level of knowledge and that migrants use preventive measures less often.\\nThe results of this investigation could form a basis to develop new ways of informing patients and informational concepts.\\nMethodology\\nThe patient survey data were collected in the following three locations in Berlin, Germany from March to June 2021: the Department of Gynecology with Center for Oncological Surgery Charité Campus Virchow Klinikum, Orthopedic Praxis Center Berlin, and at the Gynecologic Praxis Berlin Mitte.\\nA power analysis was conducted to estimate the sample size for demonstrating a difference between two groups: migrants and non-migrants. A sample size of 210 participants was required to detect with an effect size of 0.5, power\\u2009=\\u20090.95 size (alpha\\u2009=\\u20090.05, two-tailed test).\\nA total of 502 women were enrolled: 202 at the Department of Gynecology, Charité Virchow-Klinikum; 150 at Orthopedic Center Berlin; and 150 at Gynpraxis Berlin Mitte (Table\\xa01). Charité’s Berlin Ethics Committee approved the study (Reference number of ethics approval: EA4 / 02/21).\\nTable 1\\nStudy population divided into 3 locations where the patients were recruited\\nThe patients were given a patient information form and a questionnaire in German. Those aged 18 and over who could read the patient information and gave their informed consent to participate were included in the study. According to the ethics protocol, patient signatures were not required. This was to preserve anonymity on the informed consent form. The patient information form declared that by answering the questions, the respondent agreed to participate in this survey voluntarily, and the answers would be further analyzed and published. The questionnaire was answered anonymously. Therefore, no personal data that could directly identify a patient were gathered.\\nAll the eligible female patients who visited the three locations for medical treatment and had adequate German language skills were included consecutively and were approached by trained medical staff. Male patients and females under 18\\u2009years were not included. When women with a migration background had poor German skills, medical staff with the relevant foreign language skills was called in to translate. Those who did not speak German were not included in the study when a translator in the required language was unavailable.\\nThe survey consisted of 49 questions and was divided into three sections.\\nThe patients were asked about their origin, language, religion, and education level in the first part.\\nThe second section contained questions on general and gynecologic pre-existing diseases, lifestyle, physical activity, smoking, diagnostics, and treatments that had already been carried out. Finally, the third included assessing preventive measures such as vitamin D intake and knowledge of diagnostics about osteoporosis. The research questions were developed based on an interprofessional workshop between gynecologists, orthopedics and nurses and an intensive literature research. The aim of this survey was to collect data and generate a hypothesis as a basis for discussion and future strategies in patient care; not to develop and implement a new questionnaire. The comprehensibility was tested in a small group of 10 participants during a pilot phase. Therefore, no specific validation tests have been applied.\\nWe performed an inferential analysis to generate and test the hypothesis that migrant background may influence the willingness to take part in preventive measures such as undergoing bone densitometry and vitamin D intake. We performed a descriptive analysis to distinguish factors that influence the population’s level of knowledge about osteoporosis. We conducted different subgroup analyses comparing migrants from the first and second generations and patients with or without gynecologic cancer. For the purpose of our study we defined that a person has a migration background if they or at least one parent was not born with German citizenship, as suggested from Federal Statistical Office in Germany [25, 26]. Migrants born abroad are considered first generation and those born in Germany second-generation.\\nIn our study, the level of knowledge about preventive osteoporosis measures was calculated using a scale. After evaluating four questions from the questionnaire and their various positive and negative answer options, a 4-point scale was formed. The more positive answers the patients had, the more informed they were.\\nThe four questions are as follows:\\nThe evaluation was carried out according to the following scheme:\\nThe patient received one point in the survey for each positively answered question. If patients received more points when answering, it was assumed that they had a higher level of knowledge regarding bone health. Therefore, according to the number of positive answers, the patients were divided into 4 categories where 0 represented absent; 1, low; 2, moderate; and 3, a high level of knowledge.\\nThe data were evaluated using SPSS (version 24.0), a statistical data processing program. In addition to calculating the simple statistical values (absolute and relative frequencies), the Chi-Square Test was used to compare the relationship between two features. Furthermore, a binary logistic regression analysis was applied to independently check various influencing factors on vitamin D intake and on the probability of undergoing bone densitometry as a preventive measure. Finally, the impact of independent variables on the level of knowledge was evaluated using multivariate linear regression.\\nResults\\nDemographic data\\nA total of 502 patients were interviewed at the three locations, of which 65.3% (329) were non-migrants and 34.5% (173) were migrants. The latter represented first 26.1% (131) and 8.4% (42) second generation migrants. The proportion of migrants at the different locations was comparable: 36.7% at Gynpraxis Berlin Mitte, 38.0% at the Orthopedic Praxis Center Berlin, and 28.2% at the Department of Gynecology with Center for Oncological Surgery Charité Campus Virchow Klinikum (p\\u2009=\\u20090.103). The demographic characteristics of the patients from the three locations are summarized in Table \\u200bTable11.\\nThe average age was 46 for migrants and 53 for non-migrants (range 22-84). Both groups’ average body mass index was 25\\u2009kg/m2 (range 14.4 - 50.8\\u2009kg/m2). The number of high-school and university graduates was higher among migrants: 57% vs. 51%.\\nNon-migrant women are employed more frequently than migrant women (59% vs. 48% p\\u2009=\\u20090.00). When asked about religious affiliations, 48% of non-migrants vs. 18% of migrants said they had no religion. In 30.8% of migrant women, they stated Christianity as their religion, and 40.2% Islam. In contrast, only 1.8% of non-migrant women declared Islam as their religion, and 37.8% Christianity (Table\\xa02).\\nTable 2\\nDemographic data of the study population\\nRegarding the frequency and type of previous illnesses relevant to bone health, there are apparent differences between migrants and non-migrants. Non-migrants had secondary diseases (p\\u2009=\\u20090.05) more frequently such as obesity, underweight, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, thyroid diseases, rheumatic disease, and gynecologic tumor diseases compared to migrant women (Table \\u200b(Table22).\\nA positive family history of osteoporosis in the two groups (migrants and non-migrants) was indicated as 21%. In their personal medical history, 25% of the patients had suffered a fracture without trauma, and 18.5%, had had a fall.\\nLifestyle factors\\nWhen analyzing the lifestyle factors, it is noticeable that migrant women exercise less on a daily basis (59% vs. 65% - p\\u2009=\\u20090.39), smoke less (15.6% vs. 21% - p\\u2009=\\u20090.007) and consume significantly less alcohol (34.7% vs. 54.4% - p\\u2009=\\u20090.000) (Table \\u200b(Table22).\\nPreventive measures and sources of information\\nMost of the patients answered that the orthopedist (72%'}],\n",

      "Treating osteoporosis: risks and management\n",
      "SUMMARY\n",
      "Osteoporosis, osteopenia and minimal trauma fractures are becoming increasingly common in the ageing population. Fractures cause increases in morbidity and mortality and have a significant financial impact on the healthcare system and society\n",
      "Addressing risk factors for osteoporosis early may prevent or delay the onset of fractures and use of drugs. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may benefit people with a high risk of deficiency (e.g. institutionalised older people) but may not be required in people without risk factors. Impact and resistance exercises and physical activity can increase bone density and prevent falls\n",
      "Antiresorptive drugs such as bisphosphonates and denosumab remain first-line treatment options for osteoporosis. The ongoing need for bisphosphonates should be assessed after five years and treatment may then be interrupted in some patients. Progressive bone loss will recur slowly. Denosumab therapy should not be interrupted without switching to another therapy, as post-treatment bone loss can progress rapidly. All patients will need ongoing monitoring and most will require some long-term therapy once started\n",
      "Raloxifene may be considered in women who do not tolerate first-line antiresorptive drugs. Romosozumab is a new anabolic treatment for osteoporosis and, together with teriparatide, is subsidised as second-line therapy for individuals with severe disease and multiple fractures. Specialist referral should be considered for patients who sustain fractures while undergoing osteoporosis therapy\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "Osteoporosis is a common musculoskeletal disease in older people characterised by a progressive loss in bone mineral density and microarchitectural deterioration. In Australians aged over 50 years, 40–60% of women and 25–30% of men will experience a minimal trauma fracture in their lifetime.1 Fractures cause pain, disability and a reduced quality of life,2 and are associated with an increased re-fracture rate. Fractures lead to a five-year mortality rate of 25%, which increases to up to 50% in the event of a re-fracture.3 The population-attributable mortality risk associated with fractures in Australians aged 45 years and over has been found to be similar to that associated with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, highlighting the need to identify and treat osteoporosis.4\n",
      "Osteoporosis is a silent disease before a fracture occurs, so the exact prevalence is hard to determine. Even after diagnosis, it is often undertreated, with approximately 25% of Australian patients with osteoporosis having no history of receiving osteoporosis medicines.5\n",
      "Osteoporosis risk assessment\n",
      "There are a number of non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors, diseases and drugs associated with osteoporosis and minimal trauma fractures. The fracture risk for an individual can be accurately predicted using the Garvan Fracture Risk or FRAX calculators.6,7 Age, a family history of hip fractures and previous fractures are key risk factors. All men and women over the age of 50 years who have sustained a fracture have a higher risk of subsequent fractures and should be assessed and considered for treatment. Bone mineral density testing is also recommended and subsidised for all men and women over 70 years of age. Along with falls-risk screening, it is recommended as part of general health checks for all individuals, yet medical record audits indicate that this prevention strategy is currently underused.8\n",
      "Osteoporosis can be defined using bone mineral density testing, which generates a T-score and Z-score. The T-score reflects the number of deviations from the peak bone mass of age-, sex- and ethnicity-matched norms. A T-score less than –2.5 indicates a significant reduction in bone mass. The Z-score reflects the number of standard deviations from the average bone mass of age-, sex- and ethnicity-matched norms. A Z-score less than –2.0 should prompt a more complete search for secondary causes of osteoporosis.\n",
      "Management strategies\n",
      "Addressing lifestyle risk factors, appropriately treating predisposing conditions and minimising the unnecessary prescription of drugs associated with osteoporosis may slow the decline in bone density and prevent minimal trauma fractures. Some modifiable risk factors are summarised in the Box.9 Various management strategies can help decrease the risk of osteoporosis or delay its onset.\n",
      "Box\n",
      "Exercise\n",
      "Exercise throughout a person’s lifetime can delay the onset of osteoporosis. Exercise in children and adolescents is strongly associated with a higher peak bone density in adulthood. This effect is seen most with high-impact exercises such as hopping, skipping and jumping.10 Even an increase in leisurely physical activity can cause a durable increase in bone mass that can persist into early old age.11 In older people, low-impact exercises such as walking and swimming may slow the decline in bone mass, whereas higher impact exercises, resistance exercises, and combinations of different types of exercises may increase bone density.12-15\n",
      "The frequency and severity of falls may also be reduced by exercise programs, such as Stay On Your Feet and Stepping On. The main benefits are seen with programs focused on balance and function, or programs that involve multiple types of exercise (e.g. balance exercise plus resistance exercise).16 Where possible, individuals are encouraged to perform a combination of weight-bearing, resistance and balance exercises. Information regarding the types of exercises that can be recommended is available from the Healthy Bones Australia fact sheets.\n",
      "Calcium\n",
      "Adequate calcium concentrations are crucial to prevent bone loss and fractures. The recommended dietary intake of calcium is 1000–1300 mg per day, depending on age and sex. Common calcium-rich foods include dairy products, chickpeas, beans, sardines and tofu. A dietary calcium calculator is available on the International Osteoporosis Foundation website.\n",
      "Most older Australians do not achieve the recommended dietary intake of calcium. Along with information and guidance on dietary modifications, daily supplements of 500–600 mg are sometimes needed for these people. Calcium supplementation, particularly with vitamin D, can reduce the rate of bone loss and fractures in people who are deficient in calcium such as frail elderly people.17\n",
      "There is conflicting evidence regarding oral calcium supplementation and the risk of major adverse cardiac events, which include myocardial infarction and stroke. Recent meta-analyses on cardiovascular disease risk have revealed a range from a 10% relative risk reduction to a 15% relative risk increase.18-20\n",
      "Vitamin D\n",
      "Vitamin D is important for the absorption and use of calcium in the body. Evidence suggests about a third of Australians have vitamin D deficiency.21 While small amounts of vitamin D are absorbed through food, most is received from direct sunlight. Those with fair skin require 6–7 minutes of mid-morning or mid-afternoon sun exposure outdoors during the summer and up to 30 minutes during the winter to maintain adequate concentrations of vitamin D. People with darker skin will require 3–6 times the length of exposure. Additionally, window glass, full-coverage clothing and sunscreen inhibit the transmission of ultraviolet B radiation and thus vitamin D synthesis in the skin. Vitamin D synthesis is also less efficient in older people.22 Improving vitamin D concentrations reduces the risks of falls and fractures in older people,23,24 particularly when combined with adequate calcium concentrations.17,25\n",
      "Routine vitamin D supplementation for primary prophylaxis is not recommended for community-dwelling adults.26 Those who have risk factors or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency should have their vitamin D concentrations measured. These are ideally measured in late winter or early spring, when serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are the lowest. Optimal mineral metabolism, bone density and muscle function are achieved when serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are greater than 50 nanomol/L. If testing is carried out in late summer, the concentration should be 10–20 nanomol/L higher.\n",
      "Patients with vitamin D deficiency should start supplementation (Table 1). Routine vitamin D and calcium supplementation reduces the risks of falls and fractures in people with established osteoporosis or institutionalised people.17 There are very few adverse effects related to oral vitamin D supplementation. When combined with calcium, there is a small risk of hypercalcaemia, nephrolithiasis and gastrointestinal symptoms.\n",
      "Table 1\n",
      "* Alternatively, higher doses may be given less frequently when needed.\n",
      "Drugs for osteoporosis\n",
      "Pharmacotherapy is indicated for individuals with a significantly increased risk of fractures. First-line treatment is available under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for:\n",
      "Antiresorptive therapy can reduce the risk of fractures by up to 50%. There is a consensus to treat individuals who have a hip fracture risk of more than 3% or any fracture risk of more than 20% over 10 years.9 However, treatment for this indication alone is not subsidised under the PBS. There should be a shared discussion taking a patient’s fracture risk, preferences and costs into consideration, although many drugs such as bisphosphonates are inexpensive.\n",
      "Before starting drugs for osteoporosis, ensure that all patients have adequate vitamin D and calcium concentrations and that any secondary causes for osteoporosis have been managed. Table 2 summarises the common and notable rare adverse effects of different osteoporosis treatments.\n",
      "Table 2\n",
      "* Risk factors include dental extractions, implants, poorly fitting dentures, pre-existing dental disease, glucocorticoid use and smoking.\n",
      "† Risk factors include rheumatoid arthritis, increased femoral bowing, thicker lateral cortices at the femoral shaft and Asian ethnicity.\n",
      "Bisphosphonates\n",
      "Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activation and prevent bone resorption. They slow the rate of bone loss, improve bone mineral density and reduce both hip and vertebral fractures. Alendronate, risedronate and zoledronic acid are currently available for osteoporosis in Australia. Head-to-head evidence for bisphosphonates is lacking. At the time of publication, bisphosphonates are cheaper than other drug treatments.\n",
      "Oral and intravenous bisphosphonates are contraindicated in patients with renal impairment and should be avoided if the estimated glomerular filtration rate is less than 35 mL/minute/1.73 m2.27\n",
      "Safety data are robust for the use of oral bisphosphonates up to five years and intravenous bisphosphonates up to three years.28 The fracture risk should then be re-assessed, and most specialists normally extend treatment if the patients fall under any of the following high-risk categories:\n",
      "Oral and intravenous bisphosphonates can be extended up to 10 and six years, respectively, without an increase in adverse events compared to placebo.28-34 Treatment extension in these high-risk populations has been shown to be effective in preventing new vertebral fractures, but minimally beneficial for preventing hip fractures. Patients at lower risk have not been shown to experience more clinical fractures after stopping therapy due to the durable effects of bisphosphonates.28-34 If therapy is stopped, the fracture risk is generally re-assessed in 2–3 years or upon re-fracture to consider restarting therapy.\n",
      "Oral bisphosphonates\n",
      "Alendronate and risedronate are inexpensive and have once-weekly or once-monthly oral dosing. It is important to counsel patients to take oral bisphosphonates in the morning on an empty stomach with a full glass of water and to remain upright for 30 minutes after ingestion to ensure adequate drug absorption and prevent erosive oesophagitis. The main limitations of oral bisphosphonates are their upper gastrointestinal effects. Dysphagia, achalasia or an inability to remain upright for 30 minutes after tablet ingestion are absolute contraindications. They should also be used with caution in patients who have previously undergone upper gastrointestinal or bariatric surgery, as this may impair drug absorption and increase the risk of adverse events.\n",
      "Intravenous bisphosphonates\n",
      "Zoledronic acid is an intravenous bisphosphonate given as an annual infusion. It can help overcome the gastrointestinal limitations of oral formulations, but it has other potential adverse effects, most notably the risk of flu-like reactions following infusions. Myalgias and arthralgias can also occur and may be prolonged. Patients with renal impairment can be at greater risk of these reactions, and in such cases, the infusion rate could be reduced. Alternatively, a different class of drug that is not affected by renal function, such as denosumab, should be considered. There is also a small risk of atrial fibrillation and uveitis with intravenous zoledronate. Bisphosphonates have been associated with the rare and serious adverse events of atypical femoral fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw.\n",
      "Denosumab\n",
      "Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that reversibly inhibits bone resorption by reducing osteoclast formation and differentiation while increasing osteoclast apoptosis. It increases bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and hip and reduces the risk of fractures. Denosumab is administered as a six-monthly subcutaneous injection. In contrast to bisphosphonates, denosumab can be used in patients with chronic kidney disease. However, these patients are particularly at risk of hypocalcaemia, so baseline concentrations of calcium and vitamin D should be assessed before starting therapy.\n",
      "Patients should either continue denosumab indefinitely or be transitioned to an alternative treatment drug (e.g. bisphosphonates) for at least 12 months on discontinuation. Unlike bisphosphonates, the effect of denosumab is not durable and is rapidly reversible after cessation.35 Stopping denosumab or missing doses is associated with an increased risk of atraumatic vertebral fractures.35-39 The incidence of these fractures has been reported to be between 7% and 10%, with more patients sustaining multiple vertebral fractures compared to patients who have not received denosumab.35-38 These rebound effects can be seen as early as seven months after the previous dose and can persist for two years following discontinuation.38,39\n",
      "Bisphosphonates such as alendronate and zoledronic acid appear to be effective in minimising the bone loss and mitigating the increased fracture rate associated with denosuma\n"

The group of cases consisted of 100 females in postmenopausal age, in which by the DEXA method was newly diagnosed osteoporosis at the Clinic of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases, University Medical Center of RS during 2015-2016, while the control group consisted of 100 females in a postmenopausal age without diagnosed osteoporosis. The groups were matched by age (±2 years). In order to collect demographic data and information on risk factors for osteoporosis and lifestyle of patients was used the questionnaire Bone Mineral Density Questionnaire- Female of the Irish Association for osteoporosis.\\nResults:\\nTesting the significance of differences in terms of smoking showed that the studied groups are statistically significantly different in terms of smoking (χ2=24.025, p=0.000). In terms of consumption of coffee, a statistically significant difference was found between the group of cases and control group (χ2=0.615, p=0.735). When observing the obtained information about the consumption of alcohol, we find that this preventable risk factor in the present study did not show as significant for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (χ2=4.35, p=0.114). Statistical analysis shows that there are significant differences between the group of cases and control group in terms of physical activity (χ2=7.30, p=0.026). Analysis of the data of our study by univariate logistic regressions showed that smoking (p=0.000) was statistically significantly associated with osteoporosis, while physical activity is a protective factor for bone mass (p=0.036). Results of multivariate logistic regression showed that the independent risk factors for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women is smoking (OR=1.665; p=0.006).\\nConclusion:\\nThe results of our study show that smoking is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, and physical activity is a protective factor for bone mass retention. Through education and certain preventive measures should be stressed the importance of these factors on bone health from the earliest period.\\n1. INTRODUCTION\\nOsteoporosis is a disease that can be characterized as a “silent epidemic” because of its wide presence throughout the world and the continuing increase in the number of patients deserves full attention and appropriate multidisciplinary approach, both in prevention and in treatment. Close to 10% of the world’s population and 30% of post-menopausal women suffering from osteoporosis (1, 2). The main complications of osteoporosis and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly population are fractures (3). Osteoporosis involves a number of factors which can be divided into variable and constant factors i.e. genetic factors and factors from the environment (4). They can individually or in synergy significantly contribute to the loss of bone mass leading to osteoporosis (5-7). Recent scientific findings indicate that factors associated with poor living habits are also one of the most important factors contributing to the rapid loss of bone mineral density in postmenopausal women (8).\\n2. GOAL\\nThe goal of this study was to determine whether certain risk factors from the environment (smoking, drinking coffee and alcohol) contribute to the reduction of bone mineral density and occurrence of osteoporosis, and what is the impact of physical activity on bone mineral density in postmenopausal women.\\n3. MATERIAL AND METHODS\\nWorking Group (group of cases) consisted of 100 females in postmenopausal age (for at least two years after the last menstrual period) found to have a newly diagnosed osteoporosis in the Cabinet for Osteodensitometry (Clinic of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases, University Medical Center of RS) determining bone mineral density by DEXA method at the level of lumbar spine (L2-L4), hip, and the upper part of the femur.\\nThe control group (group of controls) consisted of 100 females in a postmenopausal age where after the determination of bone mineral density, by DEXA method, osteoporosis has not been determined.\\nExclusion criteria were malignant diseases, diabetes, thyroid, parathyroid and adrenal glands, chronic renal failure, inflammatory arthritis, the use of statins in the treatment of dyslipidemia, corticosteroids, hormones and diuretics for more than three months, secondary osteoporosis due to endocrine diseases, diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (Crohn’s disease, malabsorption), operations peptic ulcer, chronic liver disease, and osteoporosis induced by drugs.\\nIn order to collect demographic data and information on risk factors for osteoporosis and lifestyle of patients is used a questionnaire on Bone Mineral Density in Women of the Irish Association of Osteoporosis.\\n4. RESULTS\\nLooking at both groups, from a demographic point of view, the result shows that in the group of cases the mean age of respondents was 64 years, and in the control group 63 years which does not represent a statistically significant difference. In terms of education level in both groups dominated by women with primary or secondary education (in a group of cases 78% and in the control, group 84%), with no statistically significant difference between groups. Also in terms of occupation and marital status there were no statistically significant differences between groups (Table 1).\\nTable 1\\nIndependent indicators for the association of demographic data with osteoporosis. * X2 test ** t-test\\nTesting of the significance of differences in terms of smoking showed that the studied groups are statistically significantly different in terms of smoking (χ2=24.025, p=0.000). In the group of cases, smoking was present in 50%, and in the group of controls in 33% of the patients (Table 2).\\nTable 2\\nThe differences between group of cases and control group in terms of smoking, alcohol, coffee and physical activity\\nIn terms of consumption of coffee, a statistically significant difference was not found between the group of cases and control group (χ2=0.615, p=0.735). It can be observed that roughly the same number of women in both groups consumed coffee ≥ 3 cups/day, in a group of cases, 32% in the control group 27%. Moderate, or 1-3 cups/day consumed 37% of the women in group of cases, and 39% of respondents in control group. Coffee did not drink 31% of the women in group of cases, and34% of the control group.\\nWhen observing the obtained information about the consumption of alcohol, we find that this preventable risk factor in the present study did not show as significant for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (χ2=4.35, p=0.114). In both groups dominated by women who do not consume alcohol.\\nStatistical analysis shows that there are significant differences between the group of cases and control group in terms of physical activity (χ2=7.30, p=0.026) (Table 2).\\nTesting of variable risk factors for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women by logistic regression included all studied factors. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that smoking (p=0.000; OR=1.911) is significantly associated with the development of osteoporosis, and physical activity was protective factor for bone mineral density in women (p=0.036; OR=0.463). Coffee consumption ≥ 3 cups per day (p=0.472; OR=1.138) and alcohol >3 drinks per day (p=0.056; OR=0.352) were not significant risk factors for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (Table 3).\\nTable 3\\nRisk factors for osteoporosis identified by univariate logistic regression. * coefficient; † Odds Ratio; ‡ Confidence interval\\nResults of multivariate logistic regression showed that only smoking is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (OR=1.665; p=0.006) (Table 4).\\nTable 4\\nRisk factors for osteoporosis as identified by multivariate logistic regression * coefficient; † Odds Ratio; ‡ Confidence interval\\n5. DISCUSSION\\nOsteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease which in developed countries represent a very important social and medical problem and it is getting more and more a form of epidemic, as it has a steady increase in the number of cases (9). After age of 30 years the reduction of bone mass is an inevitable process, and consequently, changes in the bone remodeling cycle leading to bone fragility and increased risk of bone fractures (10). In osteoporosis are involved numerous factors which can be classified in the group of risk factors that cannot be influenced (unchangeable factors) and the risk factors that can be affected (variable or preventable factors) (11).\\nAmong the variable risk factors for osteoporosis, which are related to poor living habits, recent studies show that smoking has an important place because it leads to some changes in the level of microarchitecture of trabecular bone, which results in reduced bone resistance to mechanical stress and friction (12). Smokers, regardless of the gender have a higher risk of having osteoporotic fractures (13). Women who smoke are almost twice as likely affected by osteoporosis than women nonsmokers. Our results are consistent with other scientific studies, in which the prevalence of osteoporosis was much higher in the group of smokers (31.3%) compared to former smokers (28.6%) or non-smokers (7.5%) (14). The results of our study, in accordance with the previously imposed attitudes, have shown that smoking is a significant independent risk factor for osteoporosis (p=0.000, OR=1.911, 95% CI=1.378 to 2.648).\\nScientific findings on the impact of alcohol on bone mineral density show different results. According to certain studies, nonhazardous alcohol use (1.0 drinks per day) has a slightly positive effect on bone density because alcohol contains certain substances that may have the estrogen-like stimulatory effect on bone (15). Ilic and colleagues have found that a low intake of alcohol, mostly wine, is positively correlated with bone mineral density at the level of lumbar spine in postmenopausal women (16), while Berg and colleagues have shown that people who consume 0.5 to 1.0 drinks a day have a lower risk of hip fracture compared to abstainers or hazardous consumers (17). On the other hand, excessive alcohol consumption has a negative impact on the mechanism of bone remodeling, osteoblastic proliferation and activity, and therefore the direct negative effect on bone homeostasis (18). The results of univariate logistic regression in our study did not indicate that alcohol consumption of >3 drinks a day is a significant risk factor for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (OR=0.352, p=0.056). In both groups of respondents dominated abstainers which is consistent with other studies, according to which the majority of postmenopausal women do not consume alcohol. Nonhazardous alcohol consumption had 4% of the women in the group cases, and 8% in the control group, while we found hazardous alcohol consumption in 1% of respondents in the group of cases and 5% of the control group. Harmful drinking of alcohol did not report any of the respondents.\\nThe results of our study are consistent with other studies that have demonstrated the negative impact of high doses of caffeine to osteoporosis and fractures, particularly in postmenopausal women, which is a reflection of direct or indirect harmful effects of caffeine on osteoblastic activity (19,20). In fact, caffeine from coffee can lead to increased excretion of calcium in the urine, and that this loss cannot be fully compensated even 24 hours later. Caffeine intake leads to a decrease in interstitial absorption of calcium, and high doses of caffeine (>300 mg/g or ≥4 cups a day) can accelerate bone loss at the level of lumbar spine in older postmenopausal women (21). Logistic regression analysis in our study did not point that coffee consumption of ≥3 cups a day is a risk factor for osteoporosis (32% in a group of cases versus 27% in the control group (OR=1.138, p=0.472)).\\nFor healthy bone, it is necessary to regularly exercise and have physical activity, avoiding sedentary lifestyle, as if the bones are not energized and physical active, mechanoreceptors (osteocytes) do not receive signals about the need for remodeling, removal of damaged and synthesis of new bone, and so there is a gradual reduction of total bone mineral density (22). Physical activity or physical exercise in postmenopausal women have to provide the necessary voltage essential for maintaining bone density (23). Walking, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation, is one of the most effective form of exercise for the maintenance or improvement of bone mineral density in postmenopausal women (24). It was found that engaging in recreational sports or active walk (30-60 minutes) more than twice a week reduces the risk of osteoporosis and fractures in older postmenopausal women (25). Exercises by load of its own weight or exercise against resistance are effective for increasing bone density and aerobic exercises increase the balance and functional activity of muscles thus reducing the risks of falls (26). Data from other studies also suggest that physical activity is essential for bone health and the prevention of osteoporosis (27). In our study, the patients took a large percentage of cases were physically inactive, 74% in the group of cases versus 86% in the control group, which agrees with the results of other studies. The results of univariate logistic regression showed that physical activity is an important protective factor for osteoporosis (OR=0.463, p=0.036), as were women who were physically active less frequently suffered from osteoporosis.\\n6. CONCLUSION\\nMany preventable risk factors from the environment can have a significant impact on bone mineral density in postmenopausal women. The results of our study show that smoking is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, and physical activity is a protective factor for bone mineral density. Through education and certain preventive measures, it should be stressed the importance of these factors on bone health from the earliest period.\\nFootnotes\\n• Conflict of interest: none declared.\\nAuthor’s contributions: RB and JB performed the examination the patients.

Treatment should be considered in women with previous fragility fractures, DEXA-diagnosed osteoporosis and high risk of fracture. Exercise improves muscle function, can help prevent falls and has moderate effects on improvements in bone mass. Women should ensure adequate calcium intake and vitamin D. Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) effectively prevents osteoporosis and fractures, and should be encouraged in those aged < 50 years. For women aged < 60 years, MHT or tibolone can be considered, especially if they have vasomotor or genitourinary symptoms. Risedronate or bisphosphonates may then be reserved for those aged over 60 years.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nOsteoporosis is of clinical importance because it is the major risk factor for fractures. Osteoporotic fractures of the hip, spine, and forearms are associated with limitation of ambulation, physical deformity, chronic pain and disability, loss of independence, and decreased quality of life, both in Singapore(1) and globally.(2,3) Osteoporotic hip fractures are especially devastating, contributing up to 5% of all-cause mortality for men and women combined,(4) with 21%–30% dying within one year.(5)\\nHospital admissions for hip fractures projected to increase with ageing population\\nDue to an ageing population, hip fracture admissions to Singapore hospitals have increased exponentially in the new century. Rates are two- to threefold higher for every additional five years of age.(6) For Singapore women, absolute fracture numbers have increased by 3.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.0–3.6) annually, leading to an absolute average increase of 46.3 (95% CI 41–52) fractures/year (Fig. 1a).(6) However, a decreasing trend was observed when fractures rates were age-adjusted and expressed per 100,000 population (Fig. 1b), indicating the influence of ageing on the increase in absolute numbers. Following a hip fracture in Singapore, the risk of death is double (standardised mortality ratio 2.05) that of the age-matched general population in the first year, and this excess death risk was still present more than a decade later.(7) The morbidity and mortality risks after hip fractures will place a huge burden on Singapore’s healthcare system in the years to come. New preventive strategies need to be in place to arrest these trends.\\nCharts show hip fractures in Singapore from 2000 to 2017 in (a) absolute numbers and (b) age-adjusted rates per 100,000 population.

Yong EL, 2019.)\\nWomen affected by osteoporosis and fractures due to rapid bone loss in perimenopause\\nDue to increasing life expectancy, more than one-third of the average Singapore woman’s life takes place after menopause. The amount of bone mass reached at the time of menopause is key to subsequent risk of fracture. Cessation of ovarian function after menopause is associated with a precipitous decline in circulating oestrogen levels. Women have smaller and thinner bones than men, and the fall in oestrogen levels causes rapid acceleration in bone loss that starts the year before menopause and continues for another three years before de-accelerating slightly, with a moderate rate of bone loss in the subsequent 4–8 years.(8) The average decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) during the menopausal transition is about 10%, meaning that half the women are losing bone even faster, up to a 20% loss in the 5–7 years around menopause.(9) Furthermore, about 25% of postmenopausal women can be further classified as fast bone losers, as measured by bone loss rates and bone resorption markers. In Singapore, approximately 8% of midlife women have osteoporosis(10) and two-thirds of all hip fractures occur in women (Fig. 1).(6)\\nDiagnosing osteoporosis with bone mineral density scanning\\nWhile the diagnosis of osteoporosis by the presence of a fragility fracture is universally accepted, measurement of BMD with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) can accurately diagnose osteoporosis before a fracture occurs.(11) Osteoporosis occurs when BMD falls below 2.5 standard deviations (SD) as compared to the BMD of healthy young women at peak bone mass. According to the World Health Organization, every SD decrease in femoral neck BMD T-scores is associated a 2.6-fold increased risk of hip fracture.(12) Similarly, every SD decrease in BMD T-scores for the spine and distal radius increases the risk of fractures 2.3- and 1.7-fold, respectively. DEXA scanning, however, is costly at SGD 50–126 per scan and requires specialised equipment and trained staff. The cost-effectiveness of DEXA screening for a whole population at risk has not been demonstrated.(11,13) Consequently, most countries do not recommend DEXA for population-based screening, with many guidelines recommending DEXA scanning for women aged above 65 years.(3,11)\\nOpportunistic screening of midlife women for osteoporosis\\nFor women aged below 65 years, most countries screen for osteoporosis based on an opportunistic case-finding strategy,(14) wherein a formal clinical risk assessment tool is used to identify those at high risk of osteoporosis.(3,11,15) Tools developed to identify women at increased risk of osteoporosis include SCORE (Simple Calculated Osteoporosis Risk Estimation),(16) ORAI (Osteoporosis Risk Assessment Instrument),(17) OSIRIS (Osteoporosis Index of Risk)(18) and OST (Osteoporosis Self-assessment Tool).(19) Singapore’s guidelines(13,20) recommend using the Osteoporosis Screening Tool for Asians (OSTA). This tool was developed specifically for Asian women and validated in an independent sample of 1,123 Japanese women.(21) OSTA has an algorithm that gives individual risk scores for osteoporosis based on age and weight: score = age (years) − weight (kg) (Fig. 2).\\nDiagram shows osteoporosis risk stratification for Singapore women based on the Osteoporosis Screening Tool for Asians.(20)\\nFor women classified as high-risk for osteoporosis, DEXA should be considered, as the chance of finding osteoporosis is high. Those in the low-risk category can have their DEXA deferred. Risk for osteoporosis should be reassessed after five years if no clinical risk factors or significant weight loss develop since the preceding scan. Physicians should also consider a DEXA scan in women in the medium-risk category if they have other risk factors for osteoporosis, such as premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) before 40 years of age or early menopause (40–44 years of age) due to genetic, autoimmune, surgical or cancer treatment sequelae. Other risk factors include Chinese ethnicity,(10) family history of osteoporosis or fractures, height loss (> 2 cm within three years), prolonged steroid use (> 5 mg/day of prednisolone or its equivalent for > 3 months in the past year), prolonged immobility, smoking, history of falls, excessive alcohol intake (> 2 units/day) and low calcium intake (< 500 mg/day). Secondary causes of osteoporosis, such as diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis or parathyroid disease, account for up to 45% of cases of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.(22) OSTA has a sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 45%, respectively, and compares well to other more complicated tools such as SCORE,(16) ORAI(17) and OSIRIS.(18)\\nClinical risk assessment for osteoporosis using the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool\\nAlthough osteoporosis can be diagnosed with clarity, it is fractures that are of public health concern. Furthermore, the majority of hip fractures occur in individuals without osteoporosis. Therefore, an osteoporosis risk tool based on T-scores may be inaccurate in measuring fracture risk, as clinical risk factors contribute significantly to fracture risk over and above that provided by BMD T-scores. For instance, age affects the significance of any given T-score to fracture risk in women by five- to sixfold.(12) Another approach to clinical risk screening is to predict fracture risk using tools such as the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX®). FRAX (https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/FRAX/tool.aspx) calculates the patient’s ten-year probability of having a fracture using a complex algorithm that includes country, age, body mass index, ethnicity (Singapore-specific) and other risk factors. FRAX can be used with or without BMD measurements.\\nThe question arises as to why a tool for fracture risk assessment has not been adopted in Singapore. Fractures occur for many reasons other than osteoporosis. These factors include propensity for falls due to impaired mental status, cognitive and motor deficits, poor vision and balance, disequilibrium due to medications, and reduced muscle strength due to frailty. Fracture risk prediction also requires intervention thresholds that depend on socioeconomic conditions specific to each population. These conditions include overall wealth, the fraction of gross domestic product spent on healthcare, drug affordability, life expectancy with and without fractures, the cost of fracture treatment and rehabilitation and quality of life after fractures. The risk threshold for interventions may therefore vary widely from one country to another. Finally, all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of drug treatments enrolled women based on the presence of osteoporosis as assessed with BMD.(12) In practice, it is not feasible to reverse the majority of fracture risk factors, so the potential effect of their modification at the population level is substantially smaller than for osteoporosis, for which specific pharmacological interventions have proven effective. Application of United States (US) and Canadian osteoporosis screening strategies indicate that the FRAX and Garvan fracture risk calculators without BMD have specificity of < 50% and both failed to identify the majority of women who actually experienced major osteoporotic fractures during ten years of follow-up in the large Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study.(22) Nevertheless, determining fracture risk through FRAX can assist in clinical decision-making regarding treatment. Singapore-specific thresholds for treatment have been calculated at 14.0% and 3.5% for major and hip osteoporotic fractures, respectively.(23)\\nIs population-based osteoporosis screening cost-effective?\\nNo nation has reported on the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis treatment and screening on a population basis. Even modelling for the incremental cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis screening at a population level is a complex exercise.(14,24) Cost-effective screening depends on the prevalence of osteoporosis. A Japanese model-based study suggested that the cost-effectiveness of screening improves with increasing age.(25) The SCOOP (screening for prevention of fractures in older women) RCT from the United Kingdom (UK) observed that with a 10% fracture probability, hip fractures in elderly women were not significantly reduced in the intervention group compared to the control group, whereas with a 90% risk, the intervention group (vs. control group) experienced a significant 33% reduction in hip fractures.(26,27) Similarly, the ROSE RCT from Denmark observed a significant reduction in fracture risk in older women, with adjusted hazard ratios ranging from 0.74 to 0.89, limited to those at higher risk of fractures.(28) Data on the cost-effectiveness of screening at various levels of osteoporosis risk is very limited,(14,24) and this knowledge gap needs to be urgently addressed. In fact, the UK National Screening Committee in 2019(29) stated that systematic population screening is not recommended because: (a) it is not known how accurate screening tests were for the women who were screened; (b) it is not known what effect treatment and changes in lifestyle would have on some types of fracture; (c) it is not known what effect treatment and changes in lifestyle will have on women who are identified through screening as being at risk of fracture; (d) research shows that screening all women does not reduce the number of fractures compared to current care; and (e) although there is some evidence that hip fractures may be reduced by screening, more research is needed to understand if this is correct.\\nTREATMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS\\nGuidelines for drug interventions for osteoporosis are clear and have been shown to be cost-effective on a population basis.(30,31) Treatment can be considered if the woman has a previous fragility fracture,(32) a DEXA BMD T-score ≤ –2.5, or T-scores between –1 and –2.5 with high fracture risk.\\nNon-pharmacological options\\nGiven that fractures result from falls, improving muscle tone and balance through exercise can reduce the risk of falls. Resistance exercises have significant low-to-moderate effects on BMD changes in postmenopausal women.(33) Both high-load and low-load resistance training appear equally effective and have similar effects on femoral neck and lumbar spine BMD in ageing people.(34) Balance exercises popular in Singapore such as qigong,(35) tai chi and yoga can improve muscle tone and mental health, both of which are factors that affect one’s risk of osteoporosis. High-intensity resistance and impact training has recently been shown to be efficacious and induced no adverse events under highly supervised conditions in otherwise healthy postmenopausal women with low to very low bone mass.(36) However, many Singaporean women are sedentary, and it may be unpalatable for many women in hot tropical Singapore to exercise. Many women also complain of joint pains and knee problems that discourage exercise. New programmes and innovations for easily accessible exercise programmes are required, especially in this era of COVID-19 and social distancing.\\nThe value of calcium and vitamin D administration for prevention of osteoporotic fractures is unclear. In Singapore, vitamin D is derived mainly from cutaneous synthesis, with Chinese women being the most vitamin D replete and Indian women being at risk of vitamin D deficiency.(37) In a large randomised trial by WHI investigators involving more than 36,000 postmenopausal women, calcium (1,000 mg of elemental calcium supplementation daily) plus vitamin D (400 IU daily) did not have a significant effect on fractures.(38) On the other hand, large doses of vitamin D have been shown to increase the risk of fractures and are not recommended.(11) In the WHI trial, women assigned to the calcium with vitamin D group had a 17% higher risk of kidney stones than women assigned to a placebo, most likely owing to a high intake of calcium at baseline (approximately 1,150 mg/day in each group). For optimal bone health, women should have a total calcium intake of 1,000–1,500 mg/day, preferably through their diets. Supplementation of vitamin D of 600–800 IU/day is indicated in those with deficient cutaneous synthesis.\\nBesides exercise, assessment of the home for hazards, appropriate footwear, withdrawal of ‘at risk’ medications (when possible), and the use of a multidisciplinary programme to assess risk factors are prudent strategies for potentially reducing the risk of falls.\\nPharmacological therapies\\nSince osteoporosis risk increases steeply with oestrogen withdrawal at menopause, it stands to reason that oestrogen replacement should first be considered for management of osteoporosis in midlife women.(39) This was the case prior to the epochal WHI study in 2002, which reported that the health risks of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) outweigh its benefits.(40) In recent years, there has been a reconsideration of the data, leading to a more nuanced view of the complex pattern of risks and benefits of MHT.(41,42) The concept of a ‘window of opportunity’ in the ten years after menopause and before 60 years of age has gained recognition.(43) The use of MHT in healthy women before the age of 60 years did not increase all-cause mortality in the WHI study (Fig. 3). These findings led to the following age-based schema for consideration of MHT and other treatment modalities for pharmacological treatment of osteoporosis in midlife women.\\nCharts show the absolute risks of health outcomes by ten-year age groups in (a) the CEE-MPA trial and (b) the CEE alone trial of the Women’s Health Initiative hormone therapy trials during the intervention phase. (Reproduced with permission from JAMA 2013; 310:1353-68. Copyright © 2013 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.) CEE: conjugated equine oestrogens; MPA: medroxyprogesterone acetate\\nOestrogen is one of the very few drugs with both anabolic and anti-resorptive effects on bone cells.(2) Randomised, controlled trials and observational studies show that standard-dose MHT reduces hip fractures by 28% (relative risk [RR] 0.72 [0.53–0.98]), vertebrae fractures by 35% (RR 0.65 [0.46–0.92]) and other non-vertebral fractures by 27% (RR 0.73 [0.58–0.94]).(44) MHT utilises lower levels of hormones compared to oral contraceptive formulations that require supraphysiological doses to suppress ovulation, increasing its level of safety. The benefit-risk ratio is most favourable for women with oestrogen deficiency due to POI and early menopause. These women, especially those who experience surgical menopause, frequently suffer from distressing vasomotor symptoms, which MHT largely resolves. MHT also protects against genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), which affects the lower genitourinary tract and is characterised by vulval itch, vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, urge incontinence and urinary tract infection. Therapy should continue until at least the age of menopause (49 years in Singapore). Observational studies suggest that benefits outweigh risks for effects on bone, heart, cognition, genitourinary symptoms, sexual function, mood and quality of life.(39)\\nWomen without a uterus should receive oestrogen alone. Natural oestrogens administered non-orally in the form of transdermal patches or gels offer advantages such as no increased risk of stroke, venous thromboembolism (VTE) and gallstones through bypassing the first-pass hepatic effect.(45) However, there are no head-to-head RCTs to validate this effect. Conjugated equine oestrogens (CEEs), as used by the WHI, are isolated from the urine of pregnant mares and comprise estrone sulfate (weaker than estradiol) and mixtures of more than ten minor components of different active forms of oestrogens. Other common oestrogen preparations include estradiol hemihydrate and valerate. Ethinyl estradiol is a synthetic oestrogen. Ultra-low dose oestrogen (0.014 mg/day) has been shown to prevent reductions in BMD in postmenopausal women without causing uterine hyperplasia and has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).(46)\\nProgestogen is needed in women with intact uteri, as chronic unopposed oestrogen exposure increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Commonly used progestins include medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), norethindrone acetate and natural progesterone. When adequate progestogen is combined with oestrogen sequentially (10–14 days per month), the risk of endometrial neoplasia is not higher than in untreated women.(47) If the progestogen is taken continuously, the risk is lower. Regarding breast risk, the WHI saw a higher incidence of breast cancer for CEE and MPA compared with a placebo, but a reduced incidence with CEE alone.(48) A recent meta-analysis of worldwide epidemiological evidence concluded that taking five years of MHT at 50 years of age would increase breast cancer incidence at 50–69 years by: about one in every 50 users of oestrogen plus daily progestogen; one in every 70 users of oestrogen plus intermittent progestogen; and one in every 200 users of oestrogen-only preparations. There was no increased risk for oestrogen alone if only RCTs were analysed.(49)\\nRoutes of administration\\nSystemic oestrogen can be prescribed as oral tablets, transdermal patches, sprays and gels. Transdermal administration avoids the first-pass hepatic effect on coagulation factors with no increased risk of stroke, VTE and gallstones. However, there are no head-to-head RCTs to validate this supposition. Progestogens are available as oral tablets and capsules or combined with oestrogen in patches, intrauterine systems, injectables, and vaginal gels or tablets.\\nSafety considerations\\nAcross all ages, the WHI reported that MHT use was associated with an extra six strokes per 10,000 women (RR 1.24, 95% CI [1.10–1.41]), eight cases of VTE per 10,000 women (RR 1.92, 95% CI [1.36–2.69]), and four cases of pulmonary embolism per 10,000 women (RR 1.81, 95% CI [1.32–2.48]) compared with a placebo.(50) Nonetheless, the same review did not find any increased risk of stroke in women aged younger than 60 years or within ten years of menopause. Newer observational data and re-analysis of older studies by age or time since menopause, including the WHI, suggest that for healthy, recently menopausal women aged below 60 years, the benefits of MHT (oestrogen alone or with a progestogen) outweigh its risks, with fewer cardiovascular events in younger women compared to older women (Fig. 3).\\nPotential contraindications for MHT include unexplained vaginal bleeding, severe active liver disease, prior oestrogen-sensitive breast or endometrial cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, dementia, personal history or inherited high risk of thromboembolic disease, and hypertriglyceridaemia. There is also a risk of reactivation of endometriosis, worsening of migraine headaches, or growth of leiomyomas. Women with complex medical conditions should be referred for specialist review. Common side effects include nausea, bloating, weight gain, fluid retention, mood swings, breakthrough bleeding (first 3–6 months), headaches and breast tenderness.\\nMHT can be recommended to women in the 50–59 years age group, especially those with menopausal symptoms and GSM. The WHI trials identified no significant increased risk of heart disease in women randomised to receive oestrogen alone or oestrogen-progestogen therapy who were younger than 60 years or within ten years of menopause (Fig. 3). Although risk of stroke increased with oral MHT, it is a rare event in this age group, with an absolute attributable risk of less than 0.5 additional cases per 1,000 women per year.(39) Venous thrombotic events also increased with oral MHT use, but large observational studies do not identify increased risk with transdermal estradiol.(45)\\nSelective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) activate distinct tissue receptors for oestrogen. Raloxifene, a SERM that is FDA-approved to treat osteoporosis, inhibits bone resorption, increases spine BMD and decreases the risk of vertebral fractures by 40%. Nonvertebral or hip fractures are not reduced.(44) Long-term use of raloxifene decreases breast-cancer risk among high-risk women but increases the risk of thromboembolic events.\\nTibolone is a synthetic steroid with oestrogenic, progestogenic and androgenic properties. The effect on bone is similar to that of MHT and bisphosphonates with 30% lower risk of hip fractures (RR 0.69 [0.32–1.51]).(51) For menopausal symptoms, tibolone is more effective than a placebo but less effective than MHT. The side effects and contraindications are the same as those of oral MHT.\\nAlthough hormone therapy can still be considered in those with troublesome vasomotor or GSM symptoms, it should be avoided in those at higher risk of breast cancer,(52) cardiovascular disease or VTE.(53) Although meta-analyses indicate that oestrogen or hormone therapy after 60 years did not affect risk of CHD (RR 1.07, 95% CI [0.96–1.20]) or all-cause mortality (RR 1.06, 95% CI [0.95–1.18]), the risk of stroke (RR 1.21, 95% CI [1.06–1.38]) and VTE (RR 1.96, 95% CI [1.37–2.80]) increased.(50)\\nBisphosphonates may be the preferred intervention in women after 60 years. Bisphosphonates as a class represent the vast majority of prescriptions for osteoporosis treatment and are available in generic preparations. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone remodelling, and all oral bisphosphonates have been shown in randomised trials to reduce the risk of fractures. Although data from randomised trials and clinical experience indicates that they are generally safe, gastrointestinal irritation and muscle pain commonly occur. Two rare but more serious adverse effects have also been observed. These are atypical femoral fractures (i.e. fractures in the shaft of the femur that have a transverse orientation and non-comminuted morphologic features, show focal lateral cortical thickening, occur with minimal trauma, and may be bilateral) and osteonecrosis of the jaw, which is defined as exposed bone in the maxillofacial region that does not heal within eight weeks. Risks are higher if use is prolonged and assessment for drug holidays has been recommended after 1–2 years for risedronate, 3–5 years for alendronate and 3–6 years for zoledronic acid.(54) If a new fracture is experienced, fracture risk has increased or BMD remains low (femoral neck T-score ≤ −2.5), anti-osteoporotic treatment should be resumed.\\nOral bisphosphonates are now used in weekly doses (alendronate and risedronate) or monthly doses (ibandronate and risedronate). Gastrointestinal irritation may be minimised by adherence to dosing instructions, switching to an effervescent form or using risedronate. However, adherence to oral bisphosphonates is low, with less than 40% of persons who are prescribed oral preparations taking them after one year.(41) Intravenous bisphosphonates (ibandronate and zoledronic acid) are alternatives for poorly compliant patients. Use of bisphosphonates should be limited to persons with adequate renal function (creatinine clearance > 35 mL per minute) and normal serum vitamin D levels.\\nDenosumab\\nDenosumab was the first of a class of monoclonal antibodies that were approved for osteoporosis. Its action is distinct from that of bisphosphonates as it inhibits bone resorption by binding to the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kb ligand to reduce activation of osteoclasts and bone resorption. Unlike bisphosphonates, it can be used in women with compromised renal function. A large trial involving women with a BMD T-score of less than −2.5 but not less than −4.0 at the lumbar spine or total hip showed that treatment with denosumab (60 mg administered twice yearly by subcutaneous injection) resulted in a significantly lower risk of vertebral fractures (by 68%), hip fractures (by 40%), and nonvertebral fractures (by 20%) compared to a placebo.(55) As with bisphosphonates, rare cases of atypical femur fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw have been observed. Recent concerns about rapid rebound bone loss following cessation of denosumab therapy, exceeding those on placebo,(54) necessitate re-examination of its costs and benefits.(56)\\nTeriparatide\\nTeriparatide is one of the rare anabolic agents that works primarily by increasing bone formation rather than by decreasing resorption. The drug should be reserved for patients at very high risk for fractures, especially vertebral fractures, due to its cost and need for daily injections. In a 21-month trial involving women with low BMD and previous vertebral fractures, teriparatide (20 mg/day) was associated with a lower risk of vertebral fractures (by 65%) and nonvertebral fractures (by 35%) than the risk with a placebo, but not with a lower risk of hip fractures.(57) After teriparatide is discontinued, its benefits are quickly lost and thus it should be followed by an antiresorptive agent. As osteosarcomas have been observed with long-term and high-dose administration, its use should be limited to two years.\\nCONCLUSION\\nA Singapore baby girl born in 2020 has a life expectancy of 83.6 years,(58) which makes her one of the longest-living humans on the planet.(4) More than one-third of these years will be spent in menopause, where the precipitous decline in oestrogens results in accelerated bone loss, risk of osteoporosis and fracture.\\nScreening for osteoporosis in women can be based on age and weight, using OSTA, and risk factor assessment. The major risk factors for osteoporosis are age, low body mass index, early menopause, Chinese ethnicity and other secondary factors. Based on the resulting risk profile, women can be triaged to undergo DEXA scanning for definite diagnosis of osteoporosis. Women with previous fragility fractures should be offered therapy. In those with DEXA-diagnosed osteoporosis or low bone mass and high risk of fracture, treatment should be strongly considered. Exercise improves muscle function, can help prevent falls and has moderate effects on improvement of bone mass. Women should ensure adequate calcium intake. Vitamin D insufficiency can occur in those with reduced skin production due to increased pigmentation.\\nMHT effectively prevents osteoporosis and fractures in menopausal women. We recommend using the schema shown in Box 1. Before the age of 50 years, women are best served with oestrogen replacement in the form of systemic MHT until the average age of menopause, when treatment may be reassessed.(59) For women younger than 60 years of age, or who are within ten years of menopause onset, MHT or tibolone can be considered, especially if they have vasomotor or genitourinary symptoms. When alternate osteoporosis therapies are not appropriate or cause adverse events, extended use of MHT is an option for women who are at high risk of osteoporotic fracture. Risedronate can be considered in those with vertebral osteoporosis and increased breast cancer risk. Bisphosphonates may then be reserved for those over the age of 60 years and for whom MHT is contraindicated or unsuitable.\\nMenopausal hormonal therapy (MHT) and osteoporosis by age:\\nOverall drug adherence remains a problem, and health professionals involved in caring for menopausal women have an important role to correct misconceptions and ensure that osteoporosis is diagnosed and treated according to national guidelines,(20) in order to blunt the coming epidemic of fragility fractures as Singapore matures.\\nAbout the First Author\\nProf Yong Eu Leong is Professor and Emeritus Consultant, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, National University of Singapore and National University Hospital, Singapore.
